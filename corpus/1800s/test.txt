This is the Test File for the 1800s! I want to see if we can remove punctuation
and make the text lowercase too - that would be very helpful. Here is a list
of things:
 - A
 * B
 , C

 I also want to see if we can remove stopwords so heres some:

 i
me
my
myself
we
our
ours
ourselves
you
your
yours

Also, I want to test bigrams, because I do not want to have to deal with issues around phrases like "not like".

I also want to see how scoring works with words like solace .
