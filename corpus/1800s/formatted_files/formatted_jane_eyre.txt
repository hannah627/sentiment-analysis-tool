preface
a preface to the first edition of jane eyre being
unnecessary i gave none  this second edition
demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
miscellaneous remark
my thanks are due in three quarters
to the public for the indulgent ear it has inclined
to a plain tale with few pretensions
to the press for the fair field its honest suffrage
has opened to an obscure aspirant
to my publishers  for the aid their tact their
energy their practical sense and frank liberality
have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
author
the press and the public are but vague personifications for me and i must thank them in vague
terms  but my publishers are definite so are
¹ messrs smith elder and co for the very gracious
treatment which these publishers accorded charlotte brontë
the reader is referred to mrs gaskells admirable  life  of
the gifted authoress ts

certain generous critics who have encouraged me
as only large hearted and high minded men know
how to encourage a struggling stranger  to them
ie to my publishers and the select reviewers i say
cordially gentlemen i thank you from my heart
having thus acknowledged what i owe those who
have aided and approved me i turn to another class 
a small one so far as i know but not therefore to
be overlooked i mean the timorous or carping
few who doubt the tendency of such books as jane
eyre in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong 
whose ears detect in each protest against bigotrythat parent of crimean insult to piety that regent
of god on earth i would suggest to such doubters
certain obvious distinctions  i would remind them
of certain simple truths 
¹ one of these was george henry lewes the husband of
george eliot thackeray also expressed his high opinion of
jane eyre and in her letter to mr w s williams under
date december 11th 1847 charlotte brontë refers to sir
john herschel mr fonblanque and leigh hunt as having
received pleasure from the reading of her work ts
2 the quarterly review and the times both treated jane
eyre harshly the quarterly article was written by miss
rigby afterwards lady eastlake during the editorship of
j g lockhart and contains several most discourteous
animadversions on the morals of the author of jane eyre
whom miss rigby believed to be a man charlotte brontë
thought so seriously of this article that she wrote a preface

conventionality is not morality self righteousness is not religion to attack the first is not to
assail the last to pluck the mask from the face of
the pharisee is not to lift an impious hand to the
crown of thorns
men too
these things or deeds are diametrically opposed 
they are as distinct as is vice from virtue
often confound them  they should not be confounded appearance should not be mistaken for
truth  narrow human doctrines that only tend to
elate and magnify a few should not be substituted
for the worldredeeming creed of christ there is
i repeat it—a difference  and it is a good and
not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the
line of separation between them
the world may not like to see these ideas dissevered for it has been accustomed to blend them 
finding it convenient to make external show pass
for sterling worthto let whitewashed walls vouch
for clean shrines it may hate him who dares to
scrutinize and expose to raise the gilding and show
the base metal under itto penetrate the sepulchre
for the new edition of her story with the title  a word to
the quarterly  but she cancelled it for the one which was
prefixed to the second edition and which is here reprinted
ts

and reveal charnel relics  but hate as it will it is
indebted to him
ahab did not like micaiah because he never
prophesied good concerning him but evil  probably he liked the sycophant son of chenaannah
better  yet might ahab have escaped a bloody
death had he but stopped his ears to flattery and
opened them to faithful counsel
there is a man in our own days whose words are
not framed to tickle delicate ears  who to my
thinking comes before the great ones of society
much as the son of imlah came before the throned
kings of judah and israel  and who speaks truth
as deep with a power as prophetlike and as vital
a mien as dauntless and as daring is the
satirist of vanity fair admired in high places  i
cannot tell  but i think if some of those amongst
whom he hurls the greek fire of his sarcasm and
over whom he flashes the levin brand of his
denunciation were to take his warnings in time—
they or their seed might yet escape a fatal ramothgilead
why have i alluded to this man  i have alluded
to him reader because i think i see in him an
intellect profounder and more unique than his
contemporaries have yet recognized  because i

regard him as the first social regenerator of the day
as the very master of that working corps who
would restore to rectitude the warped system of
things  because i think no commentator on his
writings has yet found the comparison that suits
him the terms which rightly characterize his talent
they say he is like fielding  they talk of his wit
humour comic powers he resembles fielding as
an eagle does a vulture  fielding could stoop on
carrion but thackeray never does his wit is
bright his humour attractive but both bear the
same relation to his serious genius that the mere
lambent sheet lightning playing under the edge of
the summercloud does to the electric death spark
hid in its womb finally  i have alluded to mr
thackeray because to him—if he will accept the
tribute of a total strangeri have dedicated this
second edition of jane eyre

chapter i
there was no possibility of taking a walk that day
we had been wandering indeed in the leafless
shrubbery an hour in the morning  but since dinner
mrs reed when there was no company dined
early the cold winter wind had brought with it
clouds so sombre and a rain so penetrating that
further outdoor exercise was now out of the
question
i was glad of it  i never liked long walks
especially on chilly afternoons  dreadful to me was
the coming home in the raw twilight with nipped
fingers and toes and a heart saddened by the
chidings of bessy the nurse and humbled by the
consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza
john and georgiana reed
the said eliza john and georgiana were now
clustered round their mamma in the drawingroom 
i b
jane eyre
she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside and with
her darlings about her for the time neither
quarrelling nor crying looked perfectly happy me
she had dispensed from joining the group  saying
she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping
me at a distance  but that until she heard from
bessie and could discover by her own observation
that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire
a more sociable and child like disposition a more
attractive and sprightly mannersomething lighter
franker more natural as it were she really must
exclude me from privileges intended only for contented happy little children 
what does bessie say i have done   i asked
66 jane i dont like cavillers or questioners 
besides there is something truly forbidding in a
child taking up her elders in that manner be
seated somewhere  and until you can speak
pleasantly remain silent ”
a small breakfastroom adjoined the drawingroom  i slipped in there it contained a book case 
i soon possessed myself of a volume taking care
that it should be one stored with pictures i
mounted into the window seat  gathering up my
feet i sat cross legged like a turk  and having
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close i was
shrined in double retirement
folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the
right hand  to the left were the clear panes of glass
protecting but not separating me from the drear 2
jane eyre
november day at intervals while turning over the
leaves of my book i studied the aspect of that
winter afternoon afar it offered a pale blank of
mist and cloud  near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly
before a long and lamentable blast
i returned to my bookbewicks history of
british birds  the letterpress thereof i cared little
for generally speaking  and yet there were certain
introductory pages that child as i was i could not
pass quite as a blank they were those which treat
of the haunts of seafowl  of the solitary rocks
and promontories  by them only inhabited  of the
coast ofnorway studded with isles from its southern
extremity the lindeness or naze to the north
cape
where the northern ocean in vast whirls
boils round the naked melancholy isles
of farthest thule  and the atlantic surge
pours in among the stormy hebrides 
nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the
bleak shores of lapland siberia spitzbergen nova
zembla iceland greenland with the vast sweep
of the arctic zone and those forlorn regions of
dreary space that reservoir of frost and snow
where firm fields of ice the accumulation of centuries
of winters glazed in alpine heights above heights
surround the pole and concentre the multiplied
rigours of extreme cold  of these death white
realms i formed an idea of my own shadowy like all
3
jane eyre
the half comprehended notions that float dim through
childrens brains but strangely impressive the
words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes and gave
significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea
of billow and spray  to the broken boat stranded on
a desolate coast  to the cold and ghastly moon
glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just
sinking
i cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite
solitary churchyard with its inscribed headstone 
its gate its two trees its low horizon girdled by
a broken wall and its newlyrisen crescent attesting
the hour of eventide
the two ships becalmed on a torpid sea i believed
to be marine phantoms
the fiend pinning down the thiefs pack behind
him i passed over quickly  it was an object of
terror
so was the black horned thing seated aloof on a
rock surveying a distant crowd surrounding a
gallows
each picture told a story  mysterious often to my
undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings
yet ever profoundly interesting as interesting as
the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter
evenings when she chanced to be in good humour 
and when having brought her ironing table to the
nurseryhearth she allowed us to sit about it and
while she got up mrs reeds lace frills and crimped
4
jane eyre
her night cap borders fed our eager attention
with passages of love and adventure taken from
old fairy tales and older ballads  or as at a later
period i discovered from the pages of pamela and
henry earl of moreland
with bewick on my knee i was then happy 
happy at least in my way i feared nothing but
interruption and that came too soon the breakfastroom door opened
boh madam mope   cried the voice of john
reed  then he paused  he found the room apparently empty
where the dickens is she   he continued
lizzy  georgy   calling to his sisters  jane is
not here  tell mamma she is run out into the rain
bad animal  
it is well i drew the curtain thought i  and i
wished fervently he might not discover my hidingplace nor would john reed have found it out himself he was not quick either of vision or conception 
but eliza just put her head in at the door and said
at once 
she is in the windowseat to be sure jack 
and i came out immediately for i trembled at
the idea of being dragged forth by the said
jack
what do you want   i asked with awkward
diffidence
say what do you want master reed  was the
answer i want you to come here  and seating 
5
jane eyre
himself in an armchair he intimated by a gesture
that i was to approach and stand before him
john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old 
four years older than i for i was but ten  large and
stout for his age with a dingy and unwholesome
skin  thick lineaments in a spacious visage heavy
limbs and large extremities he gorged himself
habitually at table which made him bilious and
gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks
he ought now to have been at school  but his
mamma had taken him home for a month or two
on account of his delicate health mr miles the
master affirmed that he would do very well if he had
fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home 
but the mothers heart turned from an opinion so
harsh and inclined rather to the more refined idea
that johns sallowness was owing to overapplication
and perhaps to pining after home
john had not much affection for his mother and
sisters and an antipathy for me he bullied and
punished me  not two or three times in the week
nor once or twice in a day but continually every
nerve i had feared him and every morsel of flesh on
my bones shrank when he came near there were
moments when i was bewildered by the terror he
inspired because i had no appeal whatever against
either his menaces or his inflictions the servants
did not like to offend their young master by taking
my part against him and mrs reed was blind and
deaf on the subject  she never saw him strike or
6
jane eyre
heard him abuse me though he did both now and
then in her very presence  more frequently however behind her back
habitually obedient to john i came up to his
chair he spent some three minutes in thrusting
out his tongue at me as far as he could without
damaging the roots i knew he would soon strike
and while dreading the blow i mused on the
disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
presently deal it i wonder if he read that notion
in my face  for all at once without speaking he
struck suddenly and strongly i tottered and on
regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two
from his chair
that is for your impudence in answering mamma
awhile since said he  and for your sneaking way
of getting behind curtains and for the look you had
in your eyes two minutes since you rat  
accustomed to john reeds abuse i never had
an idea of replying to it  my care was how to endure
the blow which would certainly follow the insult
what were you doing behind the curtain   he
asked
i was reading 
show the book 
i returned to the window and fetched it thence
you have no business to take our books  you
are a dependent mamma says  you have no money 
your father left you none  you ought to beg and
not to live here with gentlemens children like us
7
jane eyre
and eat the same meals we do and wear clothes at
our mammas expense now ill teach you to
rummage my bookshelves  for they are mine  all
the house belongs to me or will do in a few years
go and stand by the door out of the way of the
mirror and the windows 
i did so not at first aware what was his intention 
but when i saw him lift and poise the book and
stand in act to hurl it i instinctively started aside
with a cry of alarm  not soon enough however  the
volume was flung it hit me and i fell striking my
head against the door and cutting it the cut bled
the pain was sharp  my terror had passed its
climax other feelings succeeded
wicked and cruel boy   i said  you are like
a murdereryou are like a slavedriveryou are like
the roman emperors  
i had read goldsmiths history of rome and had
formed my opinion of nero caligula etc also i
had drawn parallels in silence which i never thought
thus to have declared aloud
what  what   he cried  did she say that to
me 
did you hear her eliza and georgiana 
wont i tell mamma  but first
he ran headlong at me  i felt him grasp my hair
and my shoulder  he had closed with a desperate
thing i really saw in him a tyrant a murderer i
felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down
my neck and was sensible of somewhat pungent
suffering these sensations for the time predomi 
8
jane eyre
nated over fear and i received him in frantic sort
i dont very well know what i did with my hands but
he called me  rat  rat   and bellowed out aloud
aid was near him  eliza and georgiana had run for
mrs reed who was gone upstairs  she now came
upon the scene followed by bessie and her maid
abbot we were parted  i heard the words 
 dear  dear  what a fury to fly at master
john  
did ever anybody see such a picture of
passion  
then mrs reed subjoined  take her away to
the redroom and lock her in there  four hands
were immediately laid upon me and i was borne
upstairs
9
chapter il
i resisted all the way  a new thing for me and a
circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad
opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to
entertain of me the fact is i was a trifle beside
myself or rather out of myself as the french would
say i was conscious that a moments mutiny had
already rendered me liable to strange penalties and
like any other rebel slave i felt resolved in my
desperation to go all lengths
hold her arms miss abbot  shes like a mad
cat 
for shame for shame   cried the ladys maid
what shocking conduct miss eyre to strike a
young gentleman your benefactresss son  your
young master  
master  how is he my master  am i a
servant 
no  you are less than a servant for you do
nothing for your keep there sit down and think
over your wickedness
they had got me by this time into the apartment
το
jane eyre
indicated by mrs reed and had thrust me upon a
stool my impulse was to rise from it like a spring 
their two pair of hands arrested me instantly
 ifyou dont sit still you must be tied down
said bessie miss abbot lend me your garters 
she would break mine directly
miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the
necessary ligature this preparation for bonds and
the additional ignominy it inferred took a little of
the excitement out of me
 dont take them off i cried   i will not
stir 
in guarantee whereof i attached myself to my
seat by my hands
mind you dont said bessie  and when she had
ascertained that i was really subsiding she loosened
her hold of me  then she and miss abbot stood with
folded arms looking darkly and doubtfully on my
face as incredulous of my sanity
she never did so before at last said bessie
turning to the abigail
 but it was always in her  was the reply  ive
told missis often my opinion about the child and
missis agreed with me shes an underhand little
thing i never saw a girl of her age with so much
cover 
bessie answered not  but ere long addressing me
she said
you ought to be aware miss that you are under
obligations to mrs reed  she keeps you  if she
ii
jane eyre
were to turn you off you would have to go to the
poor house 
i had nothing to say to these words  they were
not new to me  my very first recollections of
existence included hints of the same kind this
reproach of my dependence had become a vague
singsong in my ear  very painful and crushing but
only half intelligible miss abbot joined in —
and you ought not to think yourself on an
equality with the misses reed and master reed
because missis kindly allows you to be brought up
with them they will have a great deal of money
and you will have none  it is your place to be
humble and to try to make yourself agreeable to
them 
what we tell you is for your good  added bessie
in no harsh voice   you should try to be useful and
pleasant then perhaps you would have a home
here  but if you become passionate and rude
missis will send you away i am sure
66 besides said miss abbot  god will punish
her  he might strike her dead in the midst of her
tantrums and then where would she go  come
bessie we will leave her  i wouldnt have her heart
for anything say your prayers miss eyre when
you are by yourself for if you dont repent something bad might be permitted to come down the
chimney and fetch you away
they went shutting the door and locking it
behind them

the redroom was a spare chamber very seldom
slept in  i might say never indeed unless when a
chance influx of visitors at gateshead hall rendered
it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained  yet it was one of the largest
and stateliest chambers in the mansion a bed
supported on massive pillars of mahogany hung
with curtains of deep red damask stood out like a
tabernacle in the centre the two large windows
with their blinds always drawn down were half
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery 
the carpet was red  the table at the foot of the bed
was covered with a crimson cloth  the walls were a
soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it  the
wardrobe the toilet table the chairs were of darkly
polished old mahogany out of these deep
surrounding shades rose high and glared white the
piledup mattresses and pillows of the bed spread
with a snowy marseilles counterpane scarcely less
prominent was an ample cushioned easy chair near
the head of the bed also white with a footstool
before it and looking as i thought like a pale
throne
this room was chill because it seldom had a fire 
it was silent because remote from the nursery and
kitchens  solemn because it was known to be
so seldom entered the housemaid alone came
here on saturdays to wipe from the mirrors and
the furniture a weeks quiet dust and mrs reed
herself at far intervals visited it to review the
13
jane eyre
contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe
where were stored divers parchments her jewelcasket and a miniature of her deceased husband 
and in those last words lies the secret of the redroomthe spell which kept it so lonely in spite of
its grandeur
mr reed had been dead nine years it was in
this chamber he breathed his last  here he lay in
state  hence his coffin was borne by the undertakers men  and since that day a sense of dreary
consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion
my seat to which bessie and the bitter miss
abbot had left me riveted was a low ottoman near
the marble chimneypiece  the bed rose before me 
to my right hand there was the high dark wardrobe
with subdued broken reflections varying the gloss
of its panels  to my left were the muffled windows 
a great lookingglass between them repeated the
vacant majesty of the bed and room i was not
quite sure whether they had locked the door  and
when i dared move i got up and went to see
alas  yes no gaol was ever more secure returning i had to cross before the lookingglass  my
fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth
it revealed all looked colder and darker in that
visionary hollow than in reality  and the strange
little figure there gazing at me with a white face
and arms specking the gloom and glittering eyes
of fear moving where all else was still had the
14
jane eyre
effect of a real spirit  i thought it like one of the
tiny phantoms half fairy half imp bessies evening
stories represented as coming out of lone ferny
dells in moors and appearing before the eyes of
belated travellers ii returned toto my stool
superstition was with me at that moment  but it
was not yet her hour for complete victory my
blood was still warm  the mood of the revolted
slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour  i
had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought
before i quailed to the dismal present
was
all john reeds violent tyrannics all his sisters
proud indifference all his mothers aversion all the
servants partiality turned up in my disturbed mind
like a dark deposit in a turbid well why was i
always suffering always browbeaten always accused
for ever condemned  why could i never please 
why was it useless to try to win anyones favour 
eliza who was headstrong and selfish
respected georgiana who had a spoiled temper
a very acrid spite a captious and insolent carriage
was universally indulged her beauty her pink
cheeks and golden curls seemed to give delight
to all who looked at her and to purchase indemnity
for every fault john no one thwarted much less
punished  though he twisted the necks of the
pigeons killed the little peachicks set the dogs
at the sheep stripped the hothouse vines of their
fruit and broke the buds off the choicest plants in
the conservatory  he called his mother  old girl
15
jane eyre
too  sometimes reviled her for her dark skin
similar to his own  bluntly disregarded her wishes 
not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire 
and he was still her own darling  i dared
commit no fault  i strove to fulfil every duty 
and i was termed naughty and tiresome sullen and
sneaking from morning to noon and from noon to
night
my head still ached and bled with the blow and
fall i had received  no one had reproved john for
wantonly striking me  and because i had turned
against him to avert farther irrational violence i
was loaded with general opprobrium
unjustunjust   said my reason forced by the
agonizing stimulus into precocious though transitory
power  and resolve equally wrought up instigated
some strange expedient to achieve escape from
insupportable oppressionas running away or if
that could not be effected never eating or drinking
more and letting myself die
what a consternation of soul was mine that
dreary afternoon  how all my brain was in tumult
and all my heart in insurrection  yet in what
darkness what dense ignorance was the mental
battle fought  i could not answer the ceaseless
inward questionwhy i thus suffered  now at the
distance of i will not say how many years i see it
clearly
i was a discord in gateshead hall  i was like
nobody there  i had nothing in harmony with
16
jane eyre
mrs reed or her children or her chosen vassalage
if they did not love me in fact as little did i love
them they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathize with one
amongst them  a heterogeneous thing opposed to
them in temperament in capacity in propensities 
a useless thing incapable of serving their interest
or adding to their pleasure  a noxious thing
cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment of contempt of their judgment i know that
had i been a sanguine brilliant careless exacting
handsome romping childthough equally dependent and friendlessmrs reed would have endured
my presence more complacently  her children
would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellowfeeling  the servants would have
been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the
nursery
daylight began to forsake the redroom  it was
past four oclock and the beclouded afternoon was
tending to drear twilight i heard the rain still
beating continuously on the staircase window and
the wind howling in the grove behind the hall  i
grew by degrees cold as a stone and then my
courage sank my habitual mood of humiliation
selfdoubt forlorn depression fell damp on the
embers of my decaying ire all said i was wicked
and perhaps i might be so  what thought had i
been but just conceiving of starving myself to
death  that certainly was a crime  and was i fit
17 c
jane eyre
to die  or was the vault under the chancel of
gateshead church an inviting bourne  in such
vault i had been told did mr reed lie buried  and
led by this thought to recall his idea i dwelt on it
with gathering dread i could not remember him 
but i knew that he was my own unclemy mothers
brotherthat he had taken me when a parentless
infant to his house  and that in his last moments
he had required a promise of mrs reed that she
would rear and maintain me as one of her own
children mrs reed probably considered she had
kept this promise  and so she had i daresay as
well as her nature would permit her  but how could
she really like an interloper not of her race and
unconnected with her after her husbands death
by any tie  it must have been most irksome to
find herself bound by a hardwrung pledge to stand
in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could
not love and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group
a singular notion dawned upon me i doubted
not never doubtedthat if mr reed had been
alive he would have treated me kindly  and now as
i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed
wallsoccasionally also turning a fascinated eye
towards the dimly gleaming mirrori began to
recall what i had heard of dead men troubled in
their graves by the violation of their last wishes
revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and
avenge the oppressed  and i thought mr reeds
18
jane eyre
spirit harassed by the wrongs of his sisters child
might quit its abodewhether in the church vault
or in the unknown world of the departedand rise
before me in this chamber i wiped my tears and
hushed my sobs fearful lest any sign of violent grief
might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me or
elicit from the gloom some haloed face bending
over me with strange pity this idea consolatory
in theory i felt would be terrible if realized  with
all my might i endeavoured to stifle iti endeavoured to be firm shaking my hair from my
eyes i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round
the dark room at this moment a light gleamed on
the wall was it i asked myself a ray from the
moon penetrating some aperture in the blind  no 
moonlight was still and this stirred  while i gazed
it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my
head i can now conjecture readily that this streak
of light was in all likelihood a gleam from a
lantern carried by someone across the lawn  but
then prepared as my mind was for horror shaken
as my nerves were by agitation i thought the swiftdarting beam was a herald of some coming vision
from another world my heart beat thick my head
grew hot  a sound filled my ears which i deemed
the rushing of wings  something seemed near me 
i was oppressed suffocated  endurance broke down 
i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate
effort steps came running along the outer passage  the key turned bessie and abbot entered
19
jane eyre
miss eyre are you ill   said bessie
what a dreadful noise  it went quite through
me  exclaimed abbot
take me out  let me go into the nursery 
was my cry
what for  are you hurt  have you seen
something   again demanded bessie
 oh  i saw a light and i thought a ghost would
come  i had now got hold of bessies hand and
she did not snatch it from me
she has screamed out on purpose declared
abbot in some disgust and what a scream  if
she had been in great pain one would have excused
it but she only wanted to bring us all here  i know
her naughty tricks 
what is all this   demanded another voice
peremptorily  and mrs reed came along the
corridor her cap flying wide her gown rustling
stormily abbot and bessie i believe i gave
orders that jane eyre should be left in the red room
till i came to her myself 
 miss jane screamed so loud maam pleaded
bessie
let her go was the only answer loose
bessies hand child  you cannot succeed in getting
out by these means be assured i abhor artifice
particularly in children  it is my duty to show you
that tricks will not answer  you will now stay here an
hour longer and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that i shall liberate you then
20
jane eyre
 oh aunt  have pity  forgive me  i cannot
endure itlet me be punished some other way  i
shall be killed if—
silence  this violence is all most repulsive  
and so no doubt she felt it  i was a precocious
actress in her eyes  she sincerely looked on me as a
compound of virulent passions mean spirit and
dangerous duplicity
bessie and abbot having retreated mrs reed
impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs
abruptly thrust me back and locked me in without
farther parley i heard her sweeping away  and
soon after she was gone i suppose i had a species
of fit  unconsciousness closed the scene
21
chapter iii
the next thing i remember is waking up with a
feeling as if i had had a frightful nightmare and
seeing before me a terrible red glare crossed with
thick black bars i heard voices too speaking with
a hollow sound and as if muffled by a rush of wind
or water agitation uncertainty and an allpredominating sense of terror confused my faculties
ere long i became aware that someone was handling me  lifting me up and supporting me in a
sitting posture and that more tenderly than i had
ever been raised or upheld before i rested my
head against a pillow or an arm and felt easy
in five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment
dissolved i knew quite well that i was in my own
bed and that the red glare was the nursery fire it
was night a candle burnt on the table  bessie
stood at the bedfoot with a basin in her hand and
a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow leaning
over me
i felt an inexpressible relief a soothing conviction
22
jane eyre
of protection and security when i knew that there
was a stranger in the room an individual not
belonging to gateshead and not related to mrs reed
turning from bessie though her presence was far
less obnoxious to me than that of abbot for
instance would have been  i scrutinized the face of
the gentleman i knew him  it was mr lloyd an
apothecary sometimes called in by mrs reed when
the servants were ailing  for herself and the children
she employed a physician
well who am i  he asked
i pronounced his name offering him at the same
time my hand  he took it smiling and saying  we
shall do very well byandby  then he laid me
down and addressing bessie charged her to be very
careful that i was not disturbed during the night
having given some further directions and intimated
that he should call again the next day he departed
to mygrief i felt so sheltered and befriended while
he sat in the chair near my pillow  and as he closed
the door after him all the room darkened and my
heart again sank  inexpressible sadness weighed it
down
do you feel as if you should sleep miss   asked
bessie rather softly
scarcely dared i answer her for i feared the next
sentence might be rough i will try
“would you like to drink or could you eat anything  
no thank you bessie
23
jane eyre
then i think i shall go to bed for it is past
twelve oclock  but you may call me if you want
anything in the night 
wonderful civility this  it emboldened me to ask
a question
bessie what is the matter with me  am i ill 
you fell sick i suppose in the redroom with
crying  youll be better soon no doubt
bessie went into the housemaids apartment which
was near i heard her say
sarah come and sleep with me in the nursery 
i darent for my life be alone with that poor child
tonight  she might die  its such a strange thing
she should have that fit  i wonder if she saw anything missis was rather too hard 
sarah came back with her  they both went to
bed  they were whispering together for half an hour
before they fell asleep i caught scraps of their
conversation from which i was able only too
distinctly to infer the main subject discussed

something passed her all dressed in white and
vanished  a great black dog behind him 
three loud raps on the chamber door — a
light in the churchyard just over his grave etc 
etc
at last both slept  the fire and the candle went
out for me the watches of that long night passed
in ghastly wakefulness  ear eye and mind were
alike strained by dread such dread as children only
can feel
24
jane eyre
no severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this
incident of the redroom  it only gave my nerves a
shock of which i feel the reverberation to this day
yes mrs reed to you i owe some fearful pangs of
mental suffering but i ought to forgive you for
you knew not what you did while rending my
heartstrings you thought you were only uprooting
my bad propensities
next day by noon i was up and dressed and sat
wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth i felt
physically weak and broken down  but my worst
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind 
a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent
tears  no sooner had i wiped one salt drop from
my cheek than another followed yet i thought i
ought to have been happy for none of the reeds
were there  they were all gone out in the carriage
with their mamma abbot too was sewing in
another room and bessie as she moved hither and
thither putting away toys and arranging drawers
addressed to me every now and then a word of
unwonted kindness this state of things should
have been to me a paradise of peace accustomed as
i was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
fagging  but in fact my racked nerves were now
in such a state that no calm could soothe and no
pleasure excite them agreeably
bessie had been down into the kitchen and she
brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly
painted china plate whose bird of paradise nestling
25
jane eyre
in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds had been
wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of
admiration  and which plate i had often petitioned
to be allowed to take in my hand in order to
examine it more closely but had always hitherto
been deemed unworthy of such a privilege this
precious vessel was now placed on my knee and i
was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate
pastry upon it vain favour  coming like most
other favours long deferred and often wished for too
late  i could not eat the tart  and the plumage of
the bird the tints of the flowers seemed strangely
faded i put both plate and tart away bessie
asked if i would have a book  the word book acted
as a transient stimulus and i begged her to fetch
gullivers travels from the library this book i
had again and again perused with delight i considered it a narrative of facts and discovered in it a
vein of interest deeper than what i found in fairy
tales for as to the elves having sought them in
vain among foxglove leaves and bells under
mushrooms and beneath the groundivy mantling
old wallnooks i had at length made up my mind
to the sad truth that they were all gone out of england to some savage country where the woods were
wilder and thicker and the population more scant 
whereas lilliput and brobdignag being in mycreed
solid parts of the earths surface i doubted not that
i might one day by taking a long voyage see with
my own eyes the little fields houses and trees the
26
jane eyre
diminutive people the tiny cows sheep and birds of
the one realm  and the cornfields foresthigh the
mighty mastiffs the monster cats the towerlike
men and women of the other yet when this
cherished volume was now placed in my handwhen i turned over its leaves and sought in its
marvellous pictures the charm i had till now never
failed to findall was eerie and dreary  the giants
were gaunt goblins the pigmies malevolent and
fearful imps gulliver a most desolate wanderer in
most dread and dangerous regions i closed the
book which i dared no longer peruse and put it on
the table beside the untasted tart
bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the
room and having washed her hands she opened a
certain little drawer full of splendid shreds of silk
and satin and began making a new bonnet for
georgianas doll meantime she sang  her song
was
in the days when we went gipsying
a long time ago
i had often heard the song before and always
with lively delight  for bessie had a sweet voiceat least i thought so but now though her voice
was still sweet i found in its melody an indescribable sadness sometimes preoccupied with her
work she sang the refrain very low very lingeringly   a long time ago came out like the
saddest cadence of a funeral hymn she passed
into another ballad this time a really doleful one

27
jane eyre
my feet they are sore and my limbs they are weary 
long is the way and the mountains are wild 
soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
over the path of the poor orphan child
why did they send me so far and so lonely
up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled 
men are hardhearted and kind angels only
watch oer the steps of a poor orphan child
yet distant and soft the nightbreeze is blowing
clouds there are none and clear stars beam mild 
god in his mercy protection is showing
comfort and hope to the poor orphan child
evn should i fall oer the broken bridge passing
or stray in the marshes by false lights beguiled
still will my father with promise and blessing
take to his bosom the poor orphan child
there is a thought that for strength should avail me
though both of shelter and kindred despoiled 
heaven is a home and a rest will not fail me 
god is a friend to the poor orphan child 
come miss jane dont cry said bessie as
she finished she might as well have said to the
fire  dont burn   but how could she divine the
morbid suffering to which i was a prey  in the
course of the morning mr lloyd came again
66what already up   said he as he entered the
nursery well nurse how is she 
66
bessie answered that i was doing very well
then she ought to look more cheerful come
here miss jane  your name is jane is it not  
yes sir jane eyre
well you have been crying miss jane eyre
can you tell me what about  have you any pain 
28
jane eyre
no sir
oh  i daresay she is crying because she could
not go out with missis in the carriage interposed
bessie
surely not  why she is too old for such
pettishness 
i thought so too  and my self esteem being
wounded by the false charge i answered promptly
 i never cried for such a thing in my life  i hate
going out in the carriage i cry because i am
miserable 
66 oh fie miss   said bessie
the good apothecary appeared a little puzzled i
was standing before him  he fixed his eyes on me
very steadily  his eyes were small and grey  not
very bright but i daresay i should think them
shrewd now he had a hardfeatured yet goodnaturedlooking face having considered me at
leisure he said  what made you ill yesterday  
she had a fall said bessie again putting in her
word
fall  why that is like a baby again  cant she
manage to walk at her age  she must be eight or
nine years old 
 i was knocked down was the blunt explanation jerked out of me by another pang of mortified
pride   but that did not make me ill i added 
while mr lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff
as he was returning the box to his waistcoatpocket a loud bell rang for the servants dinner  he
29
jane 1
eyre
knew what it was
66 thats for you nurse said he 
you can go down  ill give miss jane a lecture till
you come back 
bessie would rather have stayed but she was
obliged to go because punctuality at meals was
rigidly enforced at gateshead hall
the fall did not make you ill  what did then  
pursued mr lloyd when bessie was gone
 i was shut up in a room where there is a ghost
till after dark 
i saw mr lloyd smile and frown at the same
time ghost  what you are a baby after all 
you are afraid ofghosts  
 of mr reeds ghost i am  he died in that
room and was laid out there neither bessie nor
anyone else will go into it at night if they can
help it  and it was cruel to shut me up alone
without a candle —so cruel that i think i shall never
forget it
nonsense  and is it that makes you so
miserable  are you afraid now in daylight  
no  but night will come again before long 
and besides i am unhappyvery unhappyfor
other things 
what other things  can you tell me some of
them 
how much i wished to reply fully to this
question  how difficult it was to frame any
answer  children can feel but they cannot analyze
their feelings  and if the analysis is particularly
30
jane eyre vol i  to face page 30
gappe ston hall gteshead 
charlotte brontë was governess here in1839 

jane eyre
effected in thought they know not how to express
the result of the process in words fearful however of losing this first and only opportunity of
relieving my grief by imparting it i after a disturbed
pause contrived to frame a meagre though as far
as it went true response
for one thing i have no father or mother
brothers or sisters
you have a kind aunt and cousins
again i paused then bunglingly enounced
but john reed knocked me down and my aunt
shut me up in the redroom 
mr lloyd a second time produced his snuff box
dont you think gateshead hall a very beautiful
house asked he are you not very thankful to
have such a fine place to live at  
 it is not my house sir  and abbot says i have
less right to be here than a servant 
pooh  you cant be silly enough to wish to leave
such a splendid place  
 if i had anywhere else to go i should be glad to
leave it  but i can never get away from gateshead
till i am a woman
perhaps you maywho knows  have you any
relations besides mrs reed  
i think not sir
none belonging to your father  
i dont know i asked aunt reed once and she
said possibly i might have some poor low relations
called eyre but she knew nothing about them 
31
jane eyre
 if you had such would you like to go to
them  
i reflected poverty looks grim to grown people 
still more so to children  they have not much idea
of industrious working respectable poverty  they
think of the word only as connected with ragged
clothes scanty food fireless grates rude manners
and debasing vices  poverty for me was synonymous
with degradation
 no  i should not like to belong to poor people
was my reply
not even if they were kind to you 
i shook my head  i could not see howpoor people
had the means of being kind  and then to learn to
speak like them to adopt their manners to be
uneducated to grow up like one of the poor
women i saw sometimes nursing their children or
washing at the cottage doors of the village of gateshead no i was not heroic enough to purchase
liberty at the price of caste
but are your relatives so very poor  are they
working people  
i cannot tell  aunt reed says if i have any they
must be a beggarly set  i should not like to go abegging 
would you like to go to school  
again i reflected  i scarcely knew what school
was  bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where
young ladies sat in the stocks wore backboards and
were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise 
32
jane eyre
john reed hated his school and abused his master 
but john reeds tastes were no rule for mine and if
bessies accounts of school discipline gathered from
the young ladies of a family where she had lived
before coming to gateshead were somewhat appalling her details of certain accomplishments attained
by these same young ladies were i thought equally
attractive she boasted of beautiful paintings of
landscapes and flowers by them executed  of songs
they could sing and pieces they could play of purses
they could net of french books they could translate  till my spirit was moved to emulation as i
listened besides school would be a complete
change it implied a long journey an entire
separation from gateshead an entrance into a new
life
 i should indeed like to go to school was the
audible conclusion of my musings
well well who knows what may happen   said
mr lloyd as he got up the child ought to have
change of air and scene he added speaking to
himself  nerves not in a good state 
bessie now returned  at the same moment the
carriage was heard rolling up the gravel walk
is that your mistress nurse  asked mr lloyd
 i should like to speak to her before i go
bessie invited him to walk into the breakfastroom and led the way out in the interview which
followed between him and mrs reed i presume
from after occurrences that the apothecary
33 d
jane eyre
ventured to recommend my being sent to school 
and the recommendation was no doubt readily
enough adopted  for as abbot said in discussing
the subject with bessie when both sat sewing in the
nursery one night after i was in bed and as they
thought asleep  missus was she dared say glad
enough to get rid of such a tiresome illconditioned
child who always looked as if she were watching
everybody and scheming plots underhand  abbot
i think gave me credit for being a sort of infantine
guy fawkes
on that same occasion i learned for the first time
from miss abbots communications to bessie that
my father had been a poor clergyman  that my
mother had married him against the wishes of her
friends who considered the match beneath her 
that my grandfather reed was so irritated at her
disobedience he cut her off without a shilling  that
after my mother and father had been married a year
the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting
among the poor of a large manufacturing town
where his curacy was situated and where that
disease was prevalent  that my mother took the
infection from him and both died within a month of
each other
bessie when she heard this narrative sighed
and said poor miss jane is to be pitied too
abbot 
yes responded abbot   if she were a nice
pretty child one might compassionate her forlorn34
jane eyre
ness  but one really cannot care for such a little
toad as that 
not a great deal to be sure agreed bessie 
 at any rate a beauty like miss georgiana would be
more moving in the same condition 
yes i dote on miss georgiana   cried the
fervent abbot  little darling —with her long
curls and her blue eyes and such a sweet colour as
she has  just as if she were painted bessie i
could fancy a welsh rabbit for supper 
so could iwith a roast onion come well go
down they went
35
chapter iv
from my discourse with mr lloyd and from the
above reported conference beween bessie and
abbot i gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
motive for wishing to get well  a change seemed
neari desired and waited in silence it tarried
however days and weeks passed  i had regained
my normal state of health but no new allusion was
made to the subject over which i brooded mrs
reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye but
seldom addressed me  since my illness she had
drawn a more marked line of separation than ever
between me and her own children appointing me a
small closet to sleep in by myself condemning me
to take my meals alone and pass all my time in the
nursery while my cousins were constantly in the
drawingroom not a hint however did she drop
about sending me to school  still i felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me
under the same roof with her  for her glance now
more than ever when turned on me expressed an
insuperable and rooted aversion
36
jane eyre
eliza and georgiana evidently acting according to
orders spoke to me as little as possible  john
thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
me and once attempted chastisement  but as i
instantly turned against him roused by the same
sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
had stirred my corruption before he thought it
better to desist and ran from me uttering execrations and vowing i had burst his nose i had
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a
blow as my knuckles could inflict  and when i saw
that either that or my look daunted him i had the
greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to
purpose  but he was already with his mamma i
heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale
of how  that nasty jane eyre  had flown at him
like a mad cat  he was stopped rather harshly
dont talk to me about her john  i told
not to go near her  she is not worthy of notice
do not choose that either you or your sisters should
associate with her 
you
i
here leaning over the banister i cried out
suddenly and without at all deliberating on my
words
they are not fit to associate with me
mrs reed was rather a stout woman  but on
hearing this strange and audacious declaration she
ran nimbly up the stair swept me like a whirlwind
into the nursery and crushing me down on the
edge of my crib dared me in an emphatic voice to
37
jane eyre
rise from that place or utter one syllable during
the remainder of the day
what would uncle reed say to you if he were
alive   was my scarcely voluntary demand i say
scarcely voluntary for it seemed as if my tongue
pronounced words without my will consenting to
their utterance  something spoke out of me over
which i had no control
what  said mrs reed under her breath  her
usually cold composed grey eye became troubled
with a look like fear  she took her hand from my
arm  and gazed at me as if she really did not know
whether i were child or fiend i was now in for it
my uncle reed is in heaven and can see all you
do and think  and so can papa and mamma  they
know how you shut me up all day long and how
you wish me dead 
mrs reed soon rallied her spirits  she shook me
most soundly she boxed both my ears and then left
me without a word bessie supplied the hiatus by
a homily of an hours length in which she proved
beyond a doubt that i was the most wicked and
abandoned child ever reared under a roof i half
believed her  for i felt indeed only bad feelings
surging in my breast
november december and half of january passed
away christmas and the new year had been
celebrated at gateshead with the usual festive
cheer  presents had been interchanged dinners and
evening parties given from every enjoyment i
38
jane eyre
was of course excluded  my share of the gaiety
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of eliza
and georgiana and seeing them descend to the
drawingroom dressed out in thin muslin frocks and
scarlet sashes with hair elaborately ringleted  and
afterwards in listening to the sound of the piano or
the harp played below to the passing to and fro of
the butler and footman to the jingling of glass and
china as refreshments were handed to the broken
hum of conversation as the drawingroom doors
opened and closed  when tired of this occupation
i would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and
silent nursery  there though somewhat sad i was
not miserable to speak truth i had not the least
wish to go into company for in company i was very
rarely noticed  and if bessie had but been kind and
companionable i should have deemed it a treat
to spend the evenings quietly with her instead of
passing them under the formidable eye of mrs
reed in a room full of ladies and gentlemen but
bessie as soon as she had dressed her young ladies
used to take herself off to the lively regions of the
kitchen and housekeepers room generally bearing
the candle along with her i then sat with my doll
on my knee till the fire got low glancing round
occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than
myself haunted the shadowy room  and when the
embers sank to a dull red i undressed hastily
tugging at knots and strings as i best might and
sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib
39
jane eyre
to this crib i always took my doll  human beings
must love something and in the dearth of worthier
objects of affection i contrived to find a pleasure in
loving and cherishing a faded graven image shabby
as a miniature scarecrow it puzzles me now to
remember with what absurd sincerity i doted on
this little toy half fancying it alive and capable of
sensation i could not sleep unless it was folded in
my nightgown  and when it lay there safe and
warm i was comparatively happy believing it to be
happy likewise
long did the hours seem while i waited the
departure of the company and listened for the
sound of bessies step on the stairs sometimes
she would come up in the interval to seek her
thimble or her scissors or perhaps to bring me
something by way of suppera bun or a cheesecakethen she would sit on the bed while i ate it
and when i had finished she would tuck the clothes
round me and twice she kissed me and said
goodnight miss jane when thus gentle
bessie seemed to me the best prettiest kindest
being in the world  and i wished most intensely
that she would always be so pleasant and amiable
and never push me about or scold or task me
unreasonably as she was too often wont to do
bessie lee must i think have been a girl of good
natural capacity for she was smart in all she did
and had a remarkable knack of narrative  so at
least i judge from the impression made on me by
40
jane eyre
her nursery tales she was pretty too if my
recollections of her face and person are correct i
remember her as a slim young woman with black
hair dark eyes very nice features and good clear
complexion  but she had a capricious and hasty
temper and indifferent ideas of principle or justice 
still such as she was i preferred her to any one
else at gateshead hall
it was the fifteenth of january about nine oclock
in the morning bessie was gone down to breakfast  my cousins had not yet been summoned to
their mamma  eliza was putting on her bonnet and
warm gardencoat to go and feed her poultry an
occupation of which she was fond and not less so
of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding
up the money she thus obtained  she had a turn
for traffic and a marked propensity for saving 
shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens
but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener
about flowerroots seeds and slips of plants  that
functionary having orders from mrs reed to buy of
his young lady all the products of her parterre she
wished to sell and eliza would have sold the hair
off her head if she could have made a handsome
profit thereby as to her money she first secreted
it in odd corners wrapped up in a rag or an old
curlpaper  but some of these hoards having been
discovered by the housemaid eliza fearful of one
day losing her valued treasure consented to entrust
it to her mother at a usurious rate of interestfifty
4i
jane eyre
or sixty per cent which interest she exacted every
quarter keeping her accounts in a little book with
anxious accuracy
georgiana sat on a high stool dressing her hair
at the glass and interweaving her curls with
artificial flowers and faded feathers of which she
had found a store in a drawer in the attic i was
making my bed having received strict orders from
bessie to get it arranged before she returned for
bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of
undernurserymaid to tidy the room dust the
chairs etc having spread the quilt and folded
my nightdress i went to the windowseat to put in
order some picturebooks and dollshouse furniture
scattered there  an abrupt command from
georgiana to let her playthings alone for the tiny
chairs and mirrors the fairy plates and cups were
her property stopped my proceedings  and then
for lack of other occupation i fell to breathing on
the frostflowers with which the window was fretted
and thus clearing a space in the glass through
which i might look out on the grounds where
all was still and petrified under the influence of a
hard frost
from this window were visible the porters
lodge and the carriageroad and just as i had
dissolved so much of the silverwhite foliage
veiling the panes as left room to look out i saw
the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through
i watched it ascending the drive with indifference 
42
jane eyre
doorbell rang
carriages often came to gateshead but none ever
brought visitors in whom i was interested  it
stopped in front of the house the
loudly the new comer was admitted  all this being
nothing to me my vacant attention soon found
livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry
robin which came and chirruped on the twigs of
the leafless cherrytree nailed against the wall near
the casement the remains of my breakfast of
bread and milk stood on the table and having
crumbled a morsel of roll i was tugging at the sash
to put out the crumbs on the windowsill when
bessie came running upstairs into the nursery
 miss jane take off your pinafore  what are you
doing there  have you washed your hands and
face this morning   i gave another tug before
i answered for i wanted the bird to be secure
of its bread  the sash yielded i scattered the
crumbs some on the stone sill  some on the
cherrytree bough  then closing the window i
replied
 no bessie  i have only just finished dusting
troublesome careless child and what are you
doing now  you look quite red as if you had
been about some mischief  what were you opening
the window for  
i was spared the trouble of answering for bessie
seemed to be in too great a hurry to listen to explanations  she hauled me to the washstand inflicted a
merciless but happily brief scrub on my face and
43
jane eyre
hands with soap water and a coarse towel  disciplined my head with a bristly brush denuded me of
my pinafore and then hurrying me to the top of the
stairs bid me go down directly as i was wanted in
the breakfast room
i would have asked who wanted me  i would have
demanded if mrs reed was there but bessie was
already gone and had closed the nursery door
upon me  i slowly descended for nearly three
months i had never been called to mrs reeds
presence restricted so long to the nursery the
breakfast dining and drawing rooms were become
for me awful regions on which it dismayed me to
intrude 
i now stood in the empty hall  before me was the
breakfastroom door and i stopped intimidated
and trembling what a miserable little poltroon
had fear engendered of unjust punishment made
of me in those days  i feared to return to the
nursery and feared to go forward to the parlour 
ten minutes i stood in agitated hesitation  the
vehement ringing of the breakfastroom bell decided
me  i must enter
who could want me   i asked inwardly as with
both hands i turned the stiff doorhandle which for
a second or two resisted my efforts what should
i see beside my aunt reed in the apartment —a
man or a woman   the handle turned the door
unclosed and passing through and curtseying low
i looked up at a black pillar  —such at least
44
jane eyre
appeared to me at first sight the straight narrow
sableclad shape standing erect on the rug the
grim face at the top was like a carved mask placed
above the shaft by way of capital
mrs reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside 
she made a signal to me to approach  i did so and
she introduced me to the stony stranger with the
words ―
this is the little girl respecting whom i applied
to you
hefor it was a manturned his head slowly
towards where i stood and having examined me
with the two inquisitivelooking grey eyes which
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows said solemnly
and in a bass voice 
her size is small  what is her age 
ten years
9
so much   was the doubtful answer  and he
prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes presently
he addressed me 
your name little girl  
jane eyre sir
in uttering these words i looked up  he
seemed to me a tall gentleman but then i was
very little his features were large and they and
all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and
prim
well jane eyre and are you a good child  
impossible to reply to this in the affirmative  my
little world held a contrary opinion  i was silent
45
jane eyre
mrs reed answered for me by an expressive shake
of the head adding soon  perhaps the less said on
that subject the better mr brocklehurst
sorry indeed to hear it  she and i must have
some talk   and bending from the perpendicular
he installed his person in the armchair opposite
mrs reeds come here he said
i stepped across the rug  he placed me square
and straight before him what a face he had now
that it was almost on a level with mine  what a
great nose and what a mouth  and what large
prominent teeth 
no sight so sad as that of a naughty child he
began  especially a naughty little girl do you
know where the wicked go after death  
they go to hell was my ready and orthodox
answer
and what is hell  can you tell me that  
a pit full of fire 
and should you like to fall into that pit and to
be burning there for ever  
6
 no sir
what must you do to avoid it  
i deliberated a moment  my answer when it did
come was objectionable   i must keep in good
health and not die
how can you keep in good health  children
younger than you die daily i buried a little child
of five years only a day or two sincea good little
child whose soul is now in heaven it is to be
46
jane eyre
1
feared the same could not be said of you were you
to be called hence
not being in a condition to remove his doubt i
only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted
on the rug and sighed wishing myself far enough
away
i hope that sigh is from the heart and that you
repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress 
benefactress  benefactress   said i inwardly 
they all call mrs reed my benefactress  if so a
benefactress is a disagreeable thing
 do you say your prayers night and morning  ”
continued my interrogator
66 yes sir
do you read your bible  
sometimes 
with pleasure  are you fond of it  
 i like revelation and the book of daniel and
genesis and samuel and a little bit of exodus and
some parts of kings and chronicles and job and
jonah
andthe psalms  i hope you like them  
 no sir
no  oh shocking  i have a little boy younger
than you who knows six psalms by heart  and when
you ask him which he would rather have a gingerbread nut to eat or a verse of a psalm to learn he
says  oh the verse of a psalm  angels sing
psalms says he   i wish to be a little angel here
47
jane eyre
below he then gets two nuts in recompense for
his infant piety 
 psalms are not interesting i remarked
that proves you have a wicked heart  and you
must pray to god to change it  to give you a new
and clean one  to take away your heart of stone
and give you a heart of flesh
i was about to propound a question touching
the manner in which that operation of changing
my heart was to be performed when mrs reed
interposed telling me to sit down  she then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself
mr brocklehurst i believe i intimated in the
letter which i wrote to you three weeks ago that
this little girl has not quite the character and disposition i could wish  should you admit her into lowood
school i should be glad if the superintendent and
teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her
and above all to guard against her worst fault a
tendency to deceit i mention this in your hearing
jane that you may not attempt to impose on mr
brocklehurst
well might i dread well might i dislike mrs
reed  for it was her nature to wound me cruelly 
never was i happy in her presence  however
carefully i obeyed however strenuously i strove to
please her my efforts were still repulsed and repaid
by such sentences as the above now uttered
before a stranger the accusation cut me to the
heart i dimly perceived that she was already
48
jane eyre
obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
which she destined me to enter  i felt though i
could not have expressed the feeling that she was
sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
path  i saw myself transformed under mr brocklehursts eye into an artful noxious child and what
could i do to remedy the injury 
nothing indeed thought i as i struggled to
repress a sob and hastily wiped away some tears
the impotent evidences of my anguish
deceit is indeed a sad fault in a child  said
mr brocklehurst  it is akin to falsehood and
all liars will have their portion in the lake burning
with fire and brimstone  she shall however be
watched mrs reed i will speak to miss temple
and the teachers
i should wish her to be brought up in a manner
suiting to her prospects continued my benefactress  to be made useful to be kept humble
as for the vacations she will with your permission
spend them always at lowood 
your decisions are perfectly judicious madam 
returned mr brocklehurst humility is a christian grace and one peculiarly appropriate to the
pupils of lowood  i therefore direct that special
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation among
them i have studied how best to mortify in them
the worldly sentiment of pride and only the other
day i had a pleasing proof of my success my
second daughter augusta went with her mamma
49 e
jane eyre
to visit the school and on her return she exclaimed 
 oh dear papa how quiet and plain all the girls
at lowood look  with their hair combed behind
their ears and their long pinafores and those little
holland pockets outside their frocksthey are almost
like poor peoples children  and  said she they
looked at my dress and mammas as if they had
never seen a silk gown before  
6
this is the state of things i quite approve 
returned mrs reed had i sought all england
over i could scarcely have found a system more
exactly fitting a child like jane eyre consistency
my dear mr brocklehursti advocate consistency
in all things
consistency madam is the first of christian
duties and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment at lowood 
plain fare simple attire unsophisticated accommodations hardy and active habits  such is the
order of the day in the house and its inhabitants 
quite right sir i may then depend upon
this child being received as a pupil at lowood
and there being trained in conformity to her
position and prospects
 madam you may she shall be placed in that
nursery of chosen plantsand i trust she will
show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
of her election 
 i will send her then as soon as possible mr
brocklehurst  for i assure you i feel anxious to
50
jane eyre
be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming
too irksome
no doubt no doubt madam and now i wish
you good morning i shall return to brocklehurst
hall in the course of a week or two  my good
friend the archdeacon will not permit me to
leave him sooner i shall send miss temple
notice that she is to expect a new girl so that
there will be no difficulty about receiving her
good bye
goodbye mr brocklehurst  remember me to
mrs and miss brocklehurst and to augusta and
theodore and master broughton brocklehurst
 i will madam little girl here is a book
entitled the childs guide  read it with prayer
especially that part containing an account of the
awfully sudden death of martha g a naughty
child addicted to falsehood and deceit 
with these words mr brocklehurst put into my
hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover and having
rung for his carriage he departed
mrs reed and i were left alone  some minutes
passed in silence  she was sewing i was watching
her mrs reed might be at that time some six
or seven and thirty  she was a woman of robust
frame squareshouldered and stronglimbed not
tall and though stout not obese  she had a somewhat large face the underjaw being much
developed and very solid  her brow was low her
chin large and prominent mouth and nose suffi51
jane eyre
ciently regular  under her light eyebrows glimmered
an eye devoid of truth  her skin was dark and
opaque her hair nearly flaxen  her constitution
was sound as a bell  illness never came near her 
she was an exact clever manager her household
and tenantry were thoroughly under her control 
her children only at times defied her authority
and laughed it to scorn  she dressed well and had
a presence and port calculated to set off handsome
attire
sitting on a low stool a few yards from her armchair i examined her figure  i perused her features
in my hand i held the tract containing the sudden
death of the liar  to which narrative my attention
had been pointed as to an appropriate warning
what had just passed  what mrs reed had said
concerning me to mr brocklehurst  the whole tenor
of their conversation was recent raw and stinging
in my mind  i had felt every word as acutely as
i had heard it plainly and a passion of resentment
fomented now within me
mrs reed looked up from her work  her eye
settled on mine her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements
go out of the room  return to the nursery was
her mandate my look or something else must have
struck her as offensive for she spoke with extreme
though suppressed irritation i got up  i went
to the door  i came back again  i walked to the
window across the room then close up to her
52
jane eyre
speak i must  i had been trodden on severely
and must turn but how what strength had i to
dart retaliation at my antagonist  i gathered my
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence
i am not deceitful  if i were i should say i
loved you  but i declare i do not love you  i dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
john reed  and this book about the liar you may
give to your girl georgiana for it is she who tells
lies and not i
mrs reeds hands still lay on her work inactive 
her eye of ice still continued to dwell freezingly on
mine
“what more have you to say   she asked rather
in the tone in which a person might address an
opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used
to a child
that eye of hers that voice stirred every antipathy
i had shaking from head to foot thrilled with ungovernable excitement i continued —
i am glad you are no relation of mine i will
never call you aunt again as long as i live i will
never come to see you when i am grown up  and if
any one asks me how i liked you and how you
treated me i will say the very thought of you makes
me sick and that you treated me with miserable
cruelty
how dare you affirm that jane eyre  
how dare i mrs reed  how dare i  because
it is the truth you think i have no feelings and
53
jane eyre
that i can do without one bit of love or kindness 
but i cannot live so  and you have no pity i shall
remember how you thrust me backroughly and
violently thrust me backinto the redroom and
locked me up there to my dying day though i was
in agony though i cried out while suffocating with
distress  have mercy  have mercy aunt reed  
and that punishment you made me suffer because
your wicked boy struck meknocked me down for
nothing i will tell anybody who asks me questions
this exact tale people think you a good
woman but you are bad hard hearted you are
deceitful  
ere i had finished this reply my soul began to
expand to exult with the strangest sense offreedom
of triumph i ever felt it seemed as if an invisible
bond had burst and that i had struggled out into
unhopedfor liberty not without cause was this
sentiment  mrs reed looked frightened  her work
had slipped from her knee  she was lifting up her
hands rocking herself to and fro and even twisting
her face as if she would cry
jane you are under a mistake what is the
matter with you  why do you tremble so violently 
would you like to drink some water 
no mrs reed 
 is there anything else you wish for jane  i
assure you i desire to be your friend 
not you you told mr brocklehurst i had a
bad character a deceitful disposition  and ill let
54
jane eyre
everybody at lowood know what you are and what
you have done
 jane you dont understand these things  children must be corrected for their faults
deceit is not my fault   i cried out in a savage
high voice
but you are passionate jane that you must
allow  and now return to the nurserytheres a
dear and lie down a little
i am not your dear  i cannot lie down send
me to school soon mrs reed for i hate to live here
 i will indeed send her to school soon murmured
mrs reed sotto voce  and gathering up her work
she abruptly quitted the apartment
i was left there alonewinner of the field it
was the hardest battle i had fought and the first
victory i had gained i stood awhile on the rug
where mr brocklehurst had stood and i enjoyed my
conquerors solitude first i smiled to myself and
felt elate  but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as
fast as did the accelerated throb ofmy pulses a child
cannot quarrel with its elders as i had done 
cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play as
i had given mine  without experiencing afterwards
the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction a
ridge of lighted heath alive glancing devouring
would have been a meet emblem of my mind when i
accused and menaced mrs reed  the same ridge
black and blasted after the flames are dead would
have represented as meetly my subsequent condition
55
jane eyre
when half an hours silence and reflection had shown
me the madness of my conduct and the dreariness
of my hated and hating position
something of vengeance i had tasted for the first
time as aromatic wine it seemed on swallowing
warm and racy  its after flavour metallic and corroding gave me a sensation as if i had been poisoned
willingly would i now have gone and asked mrs
reeds pardon  but i knew partly from experience
and partly from instinct that was the way to make
her repulse me with double scorn thereby re exciting
every turbulent impulse of my nature
i would fain exercise some better faculty than that
of fierce speaking  fain find nourishment for some
less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation 
i took a booksome arabian tales  i sat down and
endeavoured to read i could make no sense of the
subject  my own thoughts swam always between me
and the page i had usually found fascinating i
opened the glass door in the breakfastroom  the
shrubbery was quite still  the black frost reigned
unbroken by sun or breeze through the grounds i
covered my head and arms with the skirt of my
frock and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestered  but i found no
pleasure in the silent trees the falling fircones the
congealed relics of autumn russet leaves swept by
past winds in heaps and now stiffened together i
leaned against a gate and looked into an empty field
where no sheep were feeding where the short grass
56
jane eyre
was nipped and blanched it was a very grey day 
a most opaque sky  onding on snaw canopied all 
then flakes fell at intervals which settled on the hard
path and on the hoary lea without melting i stood
a wretched child enough whispering to myself over
and over again what shall i do what shall
i do  
all at once i heard a clear voice call  miss jane 
where are you  come to lunch  
it was bessie i knew well enough  but i did not
stir her light step came tripping down the path
you naughty little thing   she said
dont you come when you are called  
why
bessies presence compared with the thoughts
over which i had been brooding seemed cheerful
even though as usual she was somewhat cross
the fact is after my conflict with and victory over
mrs reed i was not disposed to care much for the
nursemaids transitory anger  and i was disposed to
bask in her youthful lightness of heart i just put
my two arms round her and said  come bessie 
dont scold 
the action was more frank and fearless than any i
was habituated to indulge in somehow it pleased
her
you are a strange child miss jane she said as
she looked down at me   a little roving solitary
thing and you are going to school i suppose  
i nodded
and wont you be sorry to leave poor bessie  
57
jane eyre
what does bessie care for me she is always
scolding me
because youre such a queer frightened shy
little thing you should be bolder
what to get more knocks  
nonsense  but you are rather put upon thats
certain my mother said when she came to see me
last week that she would not like a little one of her
own to be in your place now come in and ive
some good news for you 
 i dont think you have bessie
child  what do you mean  what sorrowful
eyes you fix on me  well but missis and theyoung
ladies and master john are going out to tea this
ill ask afternoon and you shall have tea with me
cook to bake you a little cake and then you shall
help me to look over your drawers for i am soon to
pack your trunks missis intends you to leave gateshead in a day or two and you shall choose what toys
you like to take with you 
bessie you must promise not to scold me any
more till i go
well i will  but mind you are a very good girl
and dont be afraid of me dont start when i
chance to speak rather sharply  its so provoking
i dont think i shall ever be afraid of you again
bessie because i have got used to you  and i shall
soon have another set of people to dread
ifyou dread them theyll dislike you
as you do bessie 
58
jane eyre
 i dont dislike you miss  i believe i am fonder
of you than of all the others
you dont show it
you little sharp thing  youve got quite a new
way of talking what makes you so venturesome
and hardy 
why i shall soon be away from you and
besides  i was going to say something about
what had passed between me and mrs reed  but on
second thoughts i considered it better to remain
silent on that head
and so youre glad to leave me 
not at all bessie  indeed just now i am rather
sorry 
 just now  and rather  how coolly my little
lady says it  i daresay now if i were to ask you for
a kiss you wouldnt give it me  youd say youd
rather not 
ill kiss you and welcome  bend your head
down bessie stooped  we mutually embraced and
i followed her into the house quite comforted
that afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony  and
in the evening bessie told me some of her most
 enchaining stories and sang me some of her
sweetest songs even for me life had its gleams of
sunshine
i
59
chapter v
five oclock had hardly struck on the morning of
the 19th of january when bessie brought a candle
into my closet and found me already up and nearly
dressed i had risen halfan hour before her entrance
and had washed my face and put on my clothes by
the light of a halfmoon just setting whose rays
streamed through the narrow window near my crib
i was to leave gateshead that day by a coach which
passed the lodge gates at six am bessie was the
only person yet risen  she had lit a fire in the
nursery where she now proceeded to make my
breakfast few children can eat when excited with
the thoughts of a journey  nor could i bessie
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of
the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me
wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them
into my bag  then she helped me on with my pelisse
and bonnet and wrapping herself in a shawl she
and i left the nursery as we passed mrs reeds
bedroom she said  will you go in and bid missis
goodbye  
60
jane eyre
no bessie  she came to my crib last night
when you were gone down to supper and said i
need not disturb her in the morning or my cousins
either  and she told me to remember that she had
always been my best friend and to speak of her
and be grateful to her accordingly
what did you say miss  
66 nothing  i covered my face with the bedclothes
and turned from her to the wall 
that was wrong miss jane
it was quite right bessie  your missis has not
been my friend  she has been my foe
oh miss jane  dont say so  
goodbye to gateshead   cried i as we passed
through the hall and went out at the front door
the moon was set and it was very dark  bessie
carried a lantern whose light glanced on wet steps
and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw raw and
chill was the winter morning  my teeth chattered as
i hastened down the drive there was a light in
the porters lodge  when we reached it we found
the porters wife just kindling her fire  my trunk
which had been carried down the evening before
stood corded at the door it wanted but a few
minutes of six and shortly after that hour had
struck the distant roll of wheels announced the
coming coach  i went to the door and watched its
lamps approach rapidly through the gloom
 is she going by herself   asked the porters
 wife
61
jane eyre
yes
and how far is it  
66 fifty miles 
what a long way  i wonder mrs reed is not
afraid to trust her so far alone
the coach drew up  there it was at the gates with
its four horses and its top laden with passengers 
the guard and coachman loudly urged haste  my
trunk was hoisted up  i was taken from bessies
neck to which i clung with kisses
 be sure and take good care of her cried she to
the guard as he lifted me into the inside
ay ay   was the answer  the door was slapped
to a voice exclaimed  all right and on we drove
thus was i severed from bessie and gateshead 
thus whirled away to unknown and as i then
deemed remote and mysterious regions
i remember but little of the journey  i only know
that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length
and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of
miles of road we passed through several towns
and in one a very large one the coach stopped 
the horses were taken out and the passengers
alighted to dine i was carried into an inn where
the guard wanted me to have some dinner  but as
i had no appetite he left me in an immense room
with a fireplace at each end a chandelier pendant
from the ceiling and a little red gallery high up
against the wall filled with musical instruments
here i walked about for a long time feeling very
62
jane eyre
strange and mortally apprehensive of some one
coming in and kidnapping me  for i believed in
kidnappers  their exploits having frequently figured
in bessies fireside chronicles at last the guard
returned  once more i was stowed away in the
coach my protector mounted his own seat sounded
his hollow horn and away we rattled over the “ stony
street of l
the afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty 
as it waned into dusk i began to feel that we were
getting very far indeed from gateshead  we ceased
to pass through towns  the country changed  great
grey hills heaved up round the horizon as twilight
deepened we descended a valley dark with wood
and long after night had overclouded the prospect
i heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees
lulled by the sound i at last dropped asleep  i
had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation
of motion awoke me  the coach door was open and
a person like a servant was standing at it  i saw her
face and dress by the light of the lamps
is there a little girl called jane eyre here  she
asked i answered  yes and was then lifted out 
my trunk was handed down and the coach instantly
drove away
i was stiff with long sitting and bewildered with
the noise and motion of the coach  gathering my
faculties i looked about me rain wind and
darkness filled the air  nevertheless i dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it 
63
jane eyre
through this door i passed with my new guide  she
shut and locked it behind her there was now
visible a house or houses for the building spread
farwith many windows and lights burning in
some  we went up a broad pebbly path splashing
wet and were admitted at a door  then the servant
led me through a passage into a room with a fire
where she left me alone
i stood and warmed my numbed fingers over
the blaze then i looked round  there was no
candle but the uncertain light from the hearth
showed by intervals papered walls carpets
curtain shining mahogany furniture  it was a
parlour not as spacious or splendid as the
drawingroom at gateshead but comfortable
enough i was puzzling to make out the subject
of a picture on the wall when the door opened
and an individual carrying a light entered  another
followed close behind
the first was a tall lady with dark hair dark
eyes and a pale and large forehead  her figure
was partly enveloped in a shawl her countenance
was grave her bearing erect
the child is very young to be sent alone said
she putting her candle down on the table she
considered me attentively for a minute or two then
further added
she had better be put to bed soon  she looks
tired are you tired   she asked placing her hand
on my shoulder
64
jane eyre
g
a little maam
and hungry too no doubt  let her have some
supper before she goes to bed miss miller is this
the first time you have left your parents to come to
school my little girl  
i explained to her that i had no parents she
inquired how long they had been dead  then how
old i was what was my name whether i could read
 write and sew a little  then she touched my cheek
gently with her forefinger and saying  she hoped
i should be a good child dismissed me along with
miss miller
 the lady i had left might be about twentynine 
the one who went with me appeared some years
younger  the first impressed me by her voice look
tand air miss miller was more ordinary  ruddy in
complexion though of a careworn countenance 
hurried in gait and action like one who had always
a multiplicity of tasks on hand  she looked indeed
what i afterwards found she really was an underteacher led by her i passed from compartment
to compartment from passage to passage of a
large and irregular building  till emerging from
the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading
that portion of the house we had traversed we
came upon the hum of many voices and presently
entered a wide long room with great deal tables
two at each end on each of which burnt a pair of
candles and seated all round on benches a congregation of girls of every age from nine or ten to
65 f
jane eyre
twenty seen by the dim light of the dips their
number to me appeared countless though not in
reality exceeding eighty  they were uniformly
dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion
and long holland pinafores it was the hour of
study  they were engaged in conning over their
tomorrows task and the hum i had heard was
the combined result of their whispered repetitions
miss miller signed to me to sit on a bench near
the door then walking up to the top of the long
room she cried out 
monitors collect the lessonbooks and put them
away  
four tall girls arose from different tables and
going round gathered the books and removed them
miss miller again gave the word of command —
monitors fetch the suppertrays  
the tall girls went out and returned presently
each bearing a tray with portions of something
i knew not what arranged thereon and a pitcher of
water and mug in the middle of each tray the
portions were handed round  those who liked took
a draught of the water the mug being common to
all when it came to my turn i drank for i was
thirsty but did not touch the food excitement and
fatigue rendering me incapable of eating  i now
saw however that it was a thin oaten cake shared
into fragments
the meal over prayers were read by miss miller
and the classes filed off two and two upstairs
66
jane eyre
overpowered by this time with weariness i scarcely
noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was 
except that like the schoolroom i saw it was very
long tonight i was to be miss millers bedf fellow  she helped me to undress  when laid down
i glanced at the long rows of beds each of which
was quickly filled with two occupants  in ten
minutes the single light was extinguished  amidst
silence and complete darkness i fell asleep

the night passed rapidly  i was too tired even
to dream  i only once awoke to hear the wind rave
in furious gusts and the rain fall in torrents and to
be sensible that miss miller had taken her place
by my side when i again unclosed my eyes a
loud bell was ringing  the girls were up and
dressing  day had not yet begun to dawn and a
rushlight or two burnt in the room i too rose
reluctantly  it was bitter cold and i dressed as
well as i could for shivering and washed when
there was a basin at liberty which did not occur
soon as there was but one basin to six girls on
the stands down the middle of the room again
the bell rang  all formed in file two and two and
in that order descended the stairs and entered
the cold and dimlylit schoolroom  here prayers
were read by miss miller  afterwards she called
out 
form classes  
a great tumult succeeded for some minutes
during which miss miller repeatedly exclaimed
67
jane eyre
silence   and  order   when it subsided i
saw them all drawn up in four semicircles before
four chairs placed at the four tables  all held
books in their hands and a great book like a
bible lay on each table before the vacant seat
a pause of some seconds succeeded filled up by
the low vague hum of numbers  miss miller
walked from class to class hushing this indefinite
sound
a distant bell tinkled  immediately three ladies
entered the room each walked to a table and took her
seat  miss miller assumed the fourth vacant chair
which was that nearest the door and around which
the smallest of the children were assembled  to this
inferior class i was called and placed at the bottom
of it
business now began  the days collect was repeated then certain texts of scripture were said and
to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters
in the bible which lasted an hour by the time that
exercise was terminated day had fully dawned the
indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time 
the classes were marshalled and marched into
another room to breakfast how glad i was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat  i was
now nearly sick from inanition having taken so little
the day before
the refectory was agreat low ceiled gloomy room 
on two long tables smoked basins of something hot
which however to my dismay sent forth an odour
68
jane eyre
far from inviting i saw a universal manifestation of
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the
nostrils of those destined to swallow it  from the van
of the procession the tall girls of the first class rose
the whispered words 
 disgusting  the porridge is burnt again  
silence   ejaculated a voice  not that of miss
miller but one ofthe upper teachers a little and dark
personage smartly dressed but of somewhat morose
s aspect who installed herself at the top of one table
while a more buxom lady presided at the other i
looked in vain for her i had first seen the night
before  she was not visible  miss miller occupied the
foot of the table where i sat and a strange foreignlooking elderly lady the french teacher as i afterwards found took the corresponding seat at the other
board a long grace was said and a hymn sung 
then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers
and the meal began
1 ravenous and now very faint i devoured a spooneful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste 
but the first edge of hunger blunted i perceived i
had got in hand a nauseous mess  burnt porridge is
almost as bad as rotten potatoes  famine itself soon
sickens over it the spoons were moved slowly i saw
e each girl taste her food and try to swallow it  but in
most cases the effort was soon relinquished breakfast was over and none had breakfasted thanks
t having been returned for what we had not got and a
second hymn chanted the refectory was evacuated
69
jane eyre
for the schoolroom i was one of the last to go out
and in passing the tables i saw one teacher take a
basin of porridge and taste it  she looked at the
others  all their countenances expressed displeasure
and one of them the stout one whispered 
abominable stuff how shameful  
a quarter of an hour passed before lessons again
began during which the schoolroom was in a glorious
tumult  for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely and they used
their privilege the whole conversation ran on the
breakfast which one and all abused roundly poor
things  it was the sole consolation they had miss
miller was now the only teacher in the room  a group
of great girls standing about her spoke with serious
and sullen gestures i heard the name of mr
brocklehurst pronounced by some lips at which
miss miller shook her head disapprovingly  but she
made no great effort to check the general wrath 
doubtless she shared in it
a clock in the schoolroom struck nine  miss miller
left her circle and standing in the middle of the
room cried 
silence  to your seats  
discipline prevailed  in five minutes the confused
throng was resolved into order and comparative
silence quelled the babel clamour of tongues the
upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts 
but still all seemed to wait ranged on benches
down the sides of the room the eighty girls sat

motionless and erect  a quaint assemblage they appeared all with plain locks combed from their faces
not a curl visible  in brown dresses made high and
surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat
with little pockets of holland shaped something like
a highlanders purse tied in front of their frocks
and destined to serve the purpose of a workbag  all
too wearing woollen stockings and countrymade
shoes fastened with brass buckles above twenty
of those clad in this costume were fullgrown girls or
rather young women  it suited them ill and gave an
air of oddity even to the prettiest
i was still looking at them and also at intervals
examining the teachersnone of whom precisely
pleased me for the stout one was a little coarse the
dark one not a little fierce the foreigner harsh and
grotesque and miss miller poor thing  looked
purple weatherbeaten and overworked when as
my eye wandered from face to face the whole school
rose simultaneously as if moved by a common
spring
what was the matter  i had heard no order
given  i was puzzled ere i had gathered my wits
the classes were again seated  but as all eyes were
now turned to one point mine followed the general
direction and encountered the personage who had
received me last night she stood at the bottom of
the long room on the hearth for there was a fire at
each end she surveyed the two rows ofgirls silently
and gravely miss miller approaching seemed to
71
jane eyre
ask her a question and having received her answer
went back to her place and said aloud
monitor of the first class fetch the globes  
while the direction was being executed the lady
consulted moved slowly up the room i suppose i have
a considerable organ ofveneration for i retain yet the
sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced
her steps seen now in broad daylight she looked
tall fair and shapely  brown eyes with a benignant
light in their irises and a fine pencilling of long lashes
round relieved the whiteness of her large front  on
each of her temples her hair of a very dark brown
was clustered in round curls according to the fashion
of those times when neither smooth bands nor long
ringlets were in vogue  her dress also in the mode
of the day was of purple cloth relieved by a sort of
spanish trimming of black velvet  a gold watch
watches were not so common then as now shone at
her girdle let the reader add to complete the
picture refined features a complexion if pale clear 
and a stately air and carriage and he will have at
least as clearly as words can give it a correct idea of
the exterior of miss templemaria temple as i
afterwards saw the name written in a prayer book
entrusted to me to carry to church
the superintendent of lowood for such was the
lady having taken her seat before a pair of globes
placed on one of the tables summoned the first class
round her and commenced giving a lesson in
geography  the lower classes were called by the
72
jane eyre
i
teachers repetitions in history grammar etc 
went on for an hour  writing and arithmetic succeeded and music lessons were given by miss
temple to some of the elder girls the duration of
each lesson was measured by the clock which at last
struck twelve the superintendent rose 
 i have a word to address to the pupils said
she
the tumult of cessation from lessons was already
breaking forth but it sank at her voice she went
on
you had this morning a breakfast which you
could not eat you must be hungry i have ordered
that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to
all 
the teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise
it is to be done on my responsibility she added
in an explanatory tone to them and immediately
afterwards left the room
the bread and cheese was presently brought in
and distributed to the high delight and refreshment
of the whole school the order was now given to
the garden each put on a coarse straw bonnet
with strings of coloured calico and a cloak of grey
frieze i was similarly equipped and following the
stream i made my way into the open air
the garden was a wide enclosure surrounded
with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of
prospect  a covered verandah ran down one side
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided
73
jane eyre
into scores of little beds  these beds were assigned
as gardens for the pupils to cultivate and each bed
had an owner when full of flowers they would
doubtless look pretty  but now at the latter end or
january all was wintry blight and brown decay i
shuddered as i stood and looked round me  it was
an inclement day for outdoor exercise  not positively rainy but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog 
all underfoot was still soaking wet with the floods of
yesterday the stronger among the girls ran about
and engaged in active games but sundry pale and
thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth
in the verandah  and amongst these as the dense
mist penetrated to their shivering frames i heard
frequently the sound of a hollow cough
as yet i had spoken to no one nor did anybody
seem to take notice of me  i stood lonely enough 
but to that feeling of isolation i was accustomed  it
did not oppress me much i leant against a pillar
of the verandah drew my grey mantle close about
me and trying to forget the cold which nipped me
without and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed
me within delivered myself up to the employment
of watching and thinking my reflections were too
undefined and fragmentary to merit record  i
hardly yet knew where i was  gateshead and my
past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable
distance  the present was vague and strange and
of the future i could form no conjecture i looked
round the conventlike garden and then up at the
74
jane eyrevol i to face page 74
lowood cowan bridge school 

jane eyre
house  a large building half of which seemed grey
and old the other half quite new the new part
containing the schoolroom and dormitory was lit
by mullioned and latticed windows which gave it a
churchlike aspect a stone tablet over the door
bore this inscription 
ad
lowood institution this portion was rebuilt
by naomi brocklehurst of brocklehurst
hall in this county  let your light so shine before
men that they may see your good works and glorify
your father which is in heavenst matt v 16”
i read these words over and over again  i felt
that an explanation belonged to them and was
unable fully to penetrate their import i was still
pondering the signification of  institution and
endeavouring to make out a connection between the
first words and the verse of scripture when the
sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my
head i saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near
she was bent over a book on the perusal of which
she seemed intent from where i stood i could see
the title it was rasselasa name that struck me
as strange and consequently attractive in turning
a leaf she happened to look up and i said to her
directly 
is your book interesting  i had already formed
the intention of asking her to lend it to me some
day
i like it she answered after a pause of a second
or two during which she examined me
75
jane eyre
what is it about   i continued i hardly know
where i found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger the step was contrary to
my nature and habits  but i think her occupations
touched a chord of sympathy somewhere  for i too
liked reading though of a frivolous and childish
kind  i could not digest or comprehend the serious
or substantial
you may look at it replied the girl offering me
the book
i did so  a brief examination convinced me that
the contents were less taking than the title  rasselas
looked dull to my trifling taste  i saw nothing
about fairies nothing about genii  no bright variety
seemed spread over the closely printed pages i
returned it to her  she received it quietly and
without saying anything she was about to relapse
into her former studious mood again i ventured to
disturb her 
can you tell me what the writing on that stone
over the door means  what is lowood institution  
this house where you are come to live
and why do they call it institution  is it in
any way different from other schools  
 it is partly a charityschool  you and i and all
the rest of us are charitychildren i suppose you
are an orphan are not either your father or your
mother dead 
both died before i can remember 
176
jane eyre
66 well all the girls here have lost either one or
both parents and this is called an institution for
educating orphans
do we pay no money  do they keep us for
nothing 
we pay or our friends pay fifteen pounds a
year for each 
then why do they call us charity children  
because fifteen pounds is not enough for board
and teaching and the deficiency is supplied by
subscriptions 
who subscribes  
different benevolent minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in london
who was naomi brocklehurst  
the lady who built the new part of this house
as that tablet records and whose son overlooks and
directs everything here
why
because he is treasurer and manager of the
establishment 
then this house does not belong to that tall
lady who wears a watch and who said we were to
have some bread and cheese
to miss temple  oh no  i wish it did she
has to answer to mr brocklehurst for all she does
mr brocklehurst buys all our food and all our
clothes 
does he live here 
notwo miles off at a large hall  
77
jane eyre
is he a good man 
 he is a clergyman and is said to do a great deal
ofgood
did you say that tall lady was called miss
temple 
yes 
and what are the other teachers called  
the one with red cheeks is called miss smith 
she attends to the work and cuts outfor we
make our own clothes our frocks and pelisses and
everything  the little one with black hair is miss
scatcherd  she teaches history and grammar and
hears the second class repetitions  and the one
who wears a shawl and has a pockethandkerchief
tied to her side with a yellow riband is madame
pierrot  she comes from lisle in france and
teaches french 
 do you like the teachers  
well enough
 do you like the little black one and the
madame  i cannot pronounce her name as you
do 
miss scatcherd is hastyyou must take care not
to offend her  madame pierrot is not a bad sort of
person 
but miss temple is the bestisnt she  
miss temple is very good and very clever  she
is above the rest because she knows far more than
they do
have you been long here 
78
jane eyre
two years 
 are you an orphan  
66 my mother is dead
are you happy here  
you ask rather too many questions i have
given you answers enough for the present now i
want to read 
but at that moment the summons sounded for
dinner  all reentered the house the odour
which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
appetizing than that which had regaled our nostrils
at breakfast the dinner was served in two huge
tinplated vessels whence rose a strong steam
redolent of rancid fat i found the mess to consist
of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty
meat mixed and cooked together of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned
to each pupil i ate what i could and wondered
within myself whether every days fare would be
like this
after dinner we immediately adjourned to the
schoolroom lessons recommenced and were continued till five oclock
the only marked event of the afternoon was that
i saw the girl with whom i had conversed in the
verandah dismissed in disgrace by miss scatcherd
from a history class and sent to stand in the middle
of the large schoolroom the punishment seemed
to me in a high degree ignominious especially for so
great a girlshe looked thirteen or upwards i
79
jane eyre
expected she would show signs of great distress and
shame  but to my surprise she neither wept nor
blushed composed though grave she stood the
central mark of all eyes how can she bear it so
quietlyso firmly   i asked of myself were i
in her place it seems to me i should wish the earth
to open and swallow me up she looks as if she
were thinking of something beyond her punishment
beyond her situation  of something not round
her nor before her i have heard of daydreamsis
she in a day dream now her eyes are fixed on the
floor but i am sure they do not see it her sight
seems turned in gone down into her heart  she is
looking at what she can remember i believe  not at
what is really present i wonder what sort of a girl
she is whether good or naughty 
soon after five pm we had another meal consisting of a small mug of coffee and half a slice of
brown bread i devoured my bread and drank my
coffee with relish  but i should have been glad of
as much morei was still hungry half an hours
recreation succeeded then study  then the glass of
water and the piece of oatcake prayers and bed
such was my first day at lowood
80
chapter vi
the next day commenced as before  getting up and
dressing by rushlight  but this morning we were
obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing 
the water in the pitchers was frozen a change had
taken place in the weather the preceding evening
and a keen north east wind whistling through the
crevices of our bedroom windows all night long had
made us shiver in our beds and turned the contents
of the ewers to ice
before the long hour and a half of prayers and
bible reading was over i felt ready to perish with
cold breakfasttime came at last and this morning
the porridge was not burnt  the quality was eatable
the quantity small  how small my portion seemed 
i wish it had been doubled
in the course of the day i was enrolled a member
of the fourth class and regular tasks and occupations
were assigned me  hitherto i had only been a
spectator of the proceedings at lowood i was now
to become an actor therein at first being little
accustomed to learn by heart the lessons appeared
to me both long and difficult  the frequent change
81 g
jane eyre
from task to task too bewildered me  and i was
glad when about three oclock in the afternoon 
miss smith put into my hands a border of muslin
two yards long together with needle thimble etc 
and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom with directions to hem the same at that
hour most of the others were sewing likewise  but
one class still stood round miss scatcherds chair
reading and as all was quiet the subject of their
lessons could be heard together with the manner in
which each girl acquitted herself and the animadversions or commendations of miss scatcherd on the
performance it was english history  among the
readers i observed my acquaintance of the verandah 
at the commencement of the lesson her place had
been at the top of the class but for some error of
pronunciation or some inattention to stops she was
suddenly sent to the very bottom even in that
obscure position miss scatcherd continued to make
her an object of constant notice  she was continually
addressing to her such phrases as the following
burns  such it seems was her name  the girls
here were all called by their surnames as boys are
elsewhere  burns you are standing on the side of
your shoe  turn your toes out immediately  burns
you poke your chin most unpleasantly  draw it in
burns i insist on your holding your head up  i
will not have you before me in that attitude etc
etc
a chapter having been read through twice the
82
jane eyre
books were closed and the girls examined the
lesson had comprised part of the reign of charles i 
and there were sundry questions about tonnage and
poundage and shipmoney which most of them
appeared unable to answer  still every little difficulty
was solved instantly when it reached burns  her
memory seemed to have retained the substance of
the whole lesson and she was ready with answers on
every point i kept expecting that miss scatcherd
would praise her attention  but instead of that she
suddenly cried out 
you dirty disagreeable girl  you have never
cleaned your nails this morning  
burns made no answer  i wondered at her
silence
why thought i  does she not explain that she
could neither clean her nails nor wash her face as
the water was frozen 
my attention was now called off by miss smith
desiring me to hold a skein of thread  while she was
winding it she talked to me from time to time
asking whether i had ever been at school before
whether i could mark stitch knit etc till she
dismissed me i could not pursue my observations on
miss scatcherds movements when i returned to
my seat that lady was just delivering an order of
which i did not catch the import  but burns
immediately left the class and going into the small
inner room where the books were kept returned in
half a minute carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs
83
jane eyre
tied together at one end this ominous tool she
presented to miss scatcherd with a respectful
courtesy  then she quietly and without being told
unloosed her pinafore and the teacher instantly
and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes
with the bunch of twigs not a tear rose to burnss
eyes  and while i paused from my sewing because
my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
of unavailing and impotent anger not a feature of
her pensive face altered its ordinary expression
hardened girl   exclaimed miss scatcherd 
nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits 
carry the rod away 
burns obeyed  i looked at her narrowly as she
emerged from the book closet  she was just putting
back her handkerchief into her pocket and the
trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek
the playhour in the evening i thought the
pleasantest fraction of the day at lowood  the bit of
bread the draught of coffee swallowed at five oclock
had revived vitality if it had not satisfied hunger 
the long restraint of the day was slackened  the
schoolroom felt warmer than in the morningits
fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly to
supply in some measure the place of candles not
yet introduced  the ruddy gloaming the licensed
uproar the confusion of many voices gave one a
welcome sense of liberty
on the evening of the day on which i had seen
miss scatcherd flog her pupil burns i wandered as
84
jane eyre
usual among the forms and tables and laughing
groups without a companion yet not feeling lonely 
when i passed the windows i now and then lifted a
blind and looked out  it snowed fast a drift was
already forming against the lower panes  putting my
ear close to the window i could distinguish from the
gleeful tumult within the disconsolate moan of the
wind outside
probably if i had lately left a good home and kind
parents this would have been the hour when i should
most keenly have regretted the separation  that wind
would then have saddened my heart  this obscure
chaos would have disturbed my peace  as it was i
derived from both a strange excitement and reckless and feverish i wished the wind to howl more
wildly the gloom to deepen to darkness and the
confusion to rise to clamour
jumping over forms and creeping under tables i
made my way to one of the fireplaces  there kneeling
by the high wire fender i found burns absorbed
silent abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book which she read by the dim
glare of the embers
is it still rasselas  i asked coming behind
her
 yes  she said  and i have just finished it
and in five minutes more she shut it up i was
glad of this
66 now thought i  i can perhaps get her to
talk i sat down by her on the floor
85
jane eyre
what is your name besides burns  
helen 
do you come a long way from here 
i come from a place further north  quite on the
borders of scotland
will you ever go back 
i hope so  but nobody can be sure of the
future 
you must wish to leave lowood  
no  why should i  i was sent to lowood to
get an education  and it would be of no use going
away until i have attained that object 
but that teacher miss scatcherd is cruel to
you 
cruel  not at all  she is severe  she dislikes
my faults
and if i were in your place i should dislike her 
i should resist her  if she struck me with that rod i
should get it from her hand  i should break it under
her nose
probably you would do nothing of the sort  but
if you did mr brocklehurst would expel you from
the school  that would be a great grief to your
relations it is far better to endure patiently a smart
which nobody feels but yourself than to commit a
hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to
all connected with you  and besides the bible bids
us return good for evil 
but then it seems disgraceful to be flogged and
to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of
86
jane eyre
people  and you are such a great girl  i am far
younger than you and i could not bear it 
yet it would be your duty to bear it if you could
not avoid it  it is weak and silly to say you cannot
bear what it is your fate to be required to bear 
i heard her with wonder  i could not comprehend
this doctrine of endurance  and still less could i
understand or sympathize with the forbearance she
expressed for her chastiser still i felt that helen
burns considered things by a light invisible to my
eyes i suspected she might be right and i wrong
but i would not ponder the matter deeply  like
felix i put it off to a more convenient season
you say you have faults helen  what are they 
to me you seem very good 
then learn from me not to judge by appearances 
i am as miss scatcherd said slatternly  i seldom
put and never keep things in order  i am careless  i
forget rules  i read when i should learn my lessons 
i have no method  and sometimes i say like you i
cannot bear to be subjected to systematic arrangements this is all very provoking to miss scatcherd
who is naturally neat punctual and particular 
and cross and cruel i added but helen burns
would not admit my addition  she kept silence
is miss temple as severe to you as miss
scatcherd 
at the utterance of miss temples name a soft
smile flitted over her grave face
• miss temple is full of goodness  it pains her to
87
jane eyre
be severe to any one even the worst in the school 
she sees my errors and tells me of them gently  and
if i do anything worthy of praise she gives me my
meed liberally one strong proof of my wretchedly
defective nature is that even her expostulations so
mild so rational have not influence to cure me of
my faults  and even her praise though i value it
most highly cannot stimulate me to continued care
and foresight
that is curious said i   it is so easy to be
careful 
for you i have no doubt it is i observed you
in your class this morning and saw you were closely
attentive  your thoughts never seemed to wander
while miss miller explained the lesson and questioned
you now mine continually rove away  when i
should be listening to miss scatcherd and collecting
all she says with assiduity often i lose the very
sound of her voice  i fall into a sort of dream
sometimes i think i am in northumberland and
that the noises i hear round me are the bubbling
of a little brook which runs through deepden near
our house  then when it comes to myturn to reply
i have to be wakened  and having heard nothing
of what was read for listening to the visionary brook
i have no answer ready
yet how well you replied this afternoon
it was mere chance the subject on which we
had been reading had interested me this afternoon
instead of dreaming of deepden i was wondering
88
jane eyre
how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as charles the first sometimes
did  and i thought what a pity it was that with his
integrity and conscientiousness he could see no
farther than the prerogatives of the crown if he
had but been able to look to a distance and see how
what they call the spirit of the age was tending 
still i like charlesi respect himi pity him poor
murdered king  yes his enemies were the worst 
they shed blood they had no right to shed how
dared they kill him  
helen was talking to herself now she had
forgotten i could not very well understand herthat i was ignorant or nearly so of the subject she
discussed i recalled her to my level
and when miss temple teaches you do your
thoughts wander then
 no certainly not often  because miss temple
has generally something to say which is newer than
my own reflections  her language is singularly
agreeable to me and the information she communicates is often just what i wished to gain
well then with miss temple you are good  
yes in a passive way i make no effort  i
follow as inclination guides me there is no merit
in such goodness 
a great deal  you are good to those who are
good to you it is all i ever desire to be if people
were always kind and obedient to those who are
cruel and unjust the wicked people would have it
89
jane eyre
all their own way  they would never feel afraid and
so they would never alter but would grow worse
and worse when we are struck at without a
reason we should strike back again very hard  i
am sure we shouldso hard as to teach the person
who struck us never to do it again
you will change your mind i hope when you
grow older  as yet you are but a little untaught
girl
but i feel this helen  i must dislike those who
whatever i do to please them persist in disliking
me  i must resist those who punish me unjustly
it is as natural as that i should love those who show
me affection or submit to punishment when i feel it
is deserved”
heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine 
but christians and civilized nations disown it
how i dont understand 
it is not violence that best overcomes hatenor
vengeance that most certainly heals injury 
what then 
read the new testament and observe what
christ says and how he acts  make his word your
rule and his conduct your example
what does he say 
 loveyour enemies  bless them that curse you do
good to themthat hate you and despitefully use you 
then i should love mrs reed which i cannot
do  i should bless her son john which is impossible 
90
jane eyre
in her turn helen burns asked me to explain 
and i proceeded forthwith to pour out in my own
way the tale of my sufferings and resentments
bitter and truculent when excited i spoke as i felt
without reserve or softening
helen heard me patiently to the end  i expected
she would then make a remark but she said
nothing
well i asked impatiently is not mrs reed
a hardhearted bad woman 
she has been unkind to you no doubt  because
you see she dislikes your cast of character as miss
scatcherd does mine  but how minutely you
remember all she has done and said to you  what
a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to
have made on your heart  no ill usage so brands
its record on my feelings would you not be
happier if you tried to forget her severity together
with the passionate emotions it excited  life
appears to me too short to be spent in nursing
animosity or registering wrongs we are and must
be one and all burdened with faults in this world 
but the time will soon come when i trust we shall
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies 
when debasement and sin will fall from us with this
cumbrous frame of flesh and only the spark of the
spirit will remain the impalpable principle of life
and thought pure as when it left the creator to
inspire the creature  whence it came it will return
perhaps again to be communicated to some being
91
jane eyre
higher than manperhaps to pass through grada
tions of glory from the pale human soul to brighten
to the seraph  surely it will never on the contrary
be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend  no 
i cannot believe that  i hold another creed which
no one ever taught me and which i seldom mention 
but in which i delight and to which i cling for it
extends hope to all  it makes eternity a resta
mighty home not a terror and an abyss besides
with this creed i can so clearly distinguish between
the criminal and his crime  i can so sincerely
forgive the first while i abhor the last with this
creed revenge never worries my heart degradation
never too deeply disgusts me injustice never
crushes me too low  i live in calm looking to the
end
helens head always drooping sank a little lower
as she finished this sentence i saw by her look she
wished no longer to talk to me but rather to
converse with her own thoughts she was not
allowed much time for meditation  a monitor a
great rough girl presently came up exclaiming in a
strong cumberland accent
 helen burns if you dont go and put your
drawer in order and fold up your work this minute
ill tell miss scatcherd to come and look at it 
helen sighed as her reverie fled and getting up
obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay
92
chapter vil
my first quarter at lowood seemed an age and not
the golden age either  it comprised an irksome
struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to
new rules and unwonted tasks the fear of failure
in these points harassed me worse than the physical
hardships of my lot though these were no trifles
during january february and part of march the
deep snows and after their melting the almost
impassable roads prevented our stirring beyond the
garden walls except to go to church  but within these
limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open
air our clothing was insufficient to protect us from
the severe cold  we had no boots the snow got into
our shoes and melted there  our ungloved hands
became numbed and covered with chilblains as were
our feet i remember well the distracting irritation
i endured from this cause every evening when my
feet inflamed  and the torture of thrusting the
swelled raw and stiff toes into my shoes in the
morning then the scanty supply of food was
distressing  with the keen appetites of growing
children we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a
93
jane eyre
delicate invalid from this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse which pressed hardly on the
younger pupils  whenever the famished great girls
had an opportunity they would coax or menace the
little ones out of their portion many a time i
have shared between two claimants the precious
morsel of brown bread distributed at teatime  and
after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my
mug of coffee i have swallowed the remainder with
an accompaniment of secret tears forced from me
by the exigency of hunger
sundays were dreary days in that wintry season
we had to walk two miles to brocklebridge church
where our patron officiated we set out cold we
arrived at church colder  during the morning service
we became almost paralyzed it was too far to
return to dinner and an allowance of cold meat and
bread in the same penurious proportion observed in
our ordinary meals was served round between the
services
at the close of the afternoon service we returned
by an exposed and hilly road where the bitter winter
wind blowing over a range of snowy summits to the
north almost flayed the skin from our faces
i can remember miss temple walking lightly and
rapidly along our drooping line her plaid cloak
which the frosty wind fluttered gathered close about
her and encouraging us by precept and example to
keep up our spirits and march forward as she said
like stalwart soldiers the other teachers poor

things were generally themselves too much dejected
to attempt the task of cheering others
how we longed for the light and heat of a blazing
fire when we got back  but to the little ones at
least this was denied  each hearth in the schoolroom
was immediately surrounded by a double row of
great girls and behind them the younger children
crouched in groups wrapping their starved arms in
their pinafores
a little solace came at teatime in the shape of a
double ration of breada whole instead of a half
slicewith the delicious addition of a thin scrape
of butter  it was the hebdomadal treat to which we
all looked forward from sabbath to sabbath i
generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this
bounteous repast for myself  but the remainder i
was invariably obliged to part with
the sunday evening was spent in repeating by
heart the church catechism and the fifth sixth and
seventh chapters of st matthew  and in listening to
a long sermon read by miss miller whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness a frequent
interlude of these performances was the enactment
of the part of eutychus by some halfdozen of little
girls who overpowered with sleep would fall down
if not out of the third loft yet off the fourth form
and be taken up half dead the remedy was to
thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom and oblige them to stand there till the sermon
was finished sometimes their feet failed them and

they sank together in a heap  they were then
propped up with the monitors high stools
i have not yet alluded to the visits of mr brocklehurst  and indeed that gentleman was from home
during the greater part of the first month after my
arrival perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend
the archdeacon  his absence was a relief to me i
need not say that i had my own reasons for dreading
his coming but come he did at last
one afternoon i had then been three weeks at
lowood as i was sitting with a slate in my hand
puzzling over a sum in long division my eyes raised
in abstraction to the window caught sight of a figure
just passing  i recognized almost instinctively that
gaunt outline  and when two minutes after all the
school teachers included rose en masse it was not
necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose
entrance they thus greeted a long stride measured
the schoolroom and presently beside miss temple
who herself had risen stood the same black column
which had frowned on me so ominously from the
hearthrug of gateshead i now glanced sideways at
this piece of architecture yes i was right  it was
mr brocklehurst buttoned up in a surtout and
looking longer narrower and more rigid than ever
i had my own reasons for being dismayed at this
apparition  too well i remembered the perfidious
hints given by mrs reed about my disposition etc
the promise pledged by mr brocklehurst to apprise
miss temple and the teachers of my vicious nature
96
jane eyre
all along i had been dreading the fulfilment of this
promise i had been looking out daily for the
coming man whose information respecting my
past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad
child for ever  now there he was he stood at miss
temples side  he was speaking lowin her ear  i did
not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy 
and i watched her eye with painful anxiety expecting
every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a
glance ofrepugnance and contempt i listened too 
and as i happened to be seated quite at the top of
the room i caught most of what he said  its import
relieved me from immediate apprehension
 i suppose miss temple the thread i bought at
lowton will do  it struck me that it would be just
of the quality for the calico chemises and i sorted
the needles to match you may tell miss smith that
i forgot to make a memorandum of the darning
needles but she shall have some papers sent in next
week  and she is not on any account to give out
more than one at a time to each pupil  if they have
more they are apt to be careless and lose them
and oh maam  i wish the woollen stockings were
better looked to  when i was here last i went into
the kitchen garden and examined the clothes drying
on the line  there was a quantity of black hose in a
very bad state of repair  from the size of the holes
in them i was sure they had not been well mended
from time to time 
he paused
97 h
jane eyre
your directions shall be attended to sir said
miss temple
and maam he continued  the laundress tells
me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in a
week  it is too much  the rules limit them to
one
 i think i can explain that circumstance sir
agnes and catherine johnstone were invited to take
tea with some friends at lowton last thursday and
gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
occasion 
i
mr brocklehurst nodded
well for once it may pass  but please not to let
the circumstance occur too often and there is
another thing which surprised me  i find in settling
accounts with the housekeeper that a lunch consisting of bread and cheese has twice been served
out to the girls during the past fortnight how is
this  i look over the regulations and i find no such
meal as lunch mentioned who introduced this
innovation  and by what authority 
i must be responsible for the circumstance sir”
replied miss temple  the breakfast was so illprepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it 
and i dared not allow them to remain fasting till
dinnertime 
66 madam allow me an instant you are aware
that my plan in bringing up these girls is not to
accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence
but to render them hardy patient self denying
98
jane eyre
¡
should any little accidental disappointment of the
appetite occur such as the spoiling of a meal the
under or the overdressing of a dish the incident
ought not to be neutralized by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost thus pampering
the body and obviating the aim of this institution 
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification
of the pupils by encouraging themto evince fortitude
under the temporary privation a brief address on
those occasions would not be mistimed wherein a
judicious instructor would take the opportunity of
referring to the sufferings of the primitive christians 
to the torments of martyrs  to the exhortations of
our blessed lord himself calling upon his disciples
to take up their cross and follow him  to his warnings that man shall not live by bread alone but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
god  to his divine consolations  if ye suffer hunger
or thirst for my sake happy are ye  oh madam
when you put bread and cheese instead of burnt
porridge into these childrens mouths you may
indeed feed their vile bodies but you little think
how you starve their immortal souls  
mr brocklehurst again pausedperhaps overcome by his feelings miss temple had looked
down when he first began to speak to her  but she
now gazed straight before her and her face
naturally pale as marble appeared to be assuming
also the coldness and fixity of that material 
especially her mouth closed as if it would have
99
jane eyre
required a sculptors chisel to open it and her brow
settled gradually into petrified severity
meantime mr brocklehurst standing on the
hearth with his hands behind his back majestically
surveyed the whole school suddenly his eye gave a
blink as if it had met something that either dazzled
or shocked its pupil  turning he said in more rapid
accents than he had hitherto used 
miss temple miss temple whatwhat is that
girl with curled hair  red hair maam curledcurled all over  and extending his cane he pointed
to the awful object his hand shaking as he did so
 it is julia severn replied miss temple very
quietly
julia severn maam  and why has she or any
other curled hair  why in defiance of every
precept and principle of this house does she conform to the world so openlyhere in an evangelical
charitable establishmentas to wear her hair one
mass of curls  
 julias hair curls naturally returned miss
temple still more quietly
naturally  yes but we are not to conform to
nature i wish these girls to be the children of
grace  and why that abundance  i have again and
again intimated that i desire the hair to be arranged
closely modestly plainly miss temple that girls
hair must be cut off entirely  i will send a barber
tomorrow and i see others who have far too much of
the excrescencethat tall girl tell her to turn round
100
jane eyre
tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces
to the wall 
miss temple passed her handkerchief over her lips
as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled
them  she gave the order however and when the
first class could take in what was required of them
they obeyed leaning a little back on my bench i
could see the looks and grimaces with which they
commented on this manœuvre it was a pity mr
brocklehurst could not see them too  he would
perhaps have felt that whatever he might do with
the outside of the cup and platter the inside was
further beyond his interference than he imagined
he scrutinized the reverse of these living medals
some five minutes then pronounced sentence
these words fell like the knell of doom 
all those top knots must be cut off
miss temple seemed to remonstrate
 madam he pursued  i have a master to serve
whose kingdom is not of this world  my mission is
to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh  to
teach them to clothe themselves with shamefacedness
and sobriety not with braided hair and costly
apparel  and each of the young persons before us
has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
itself might have woven  these i repeat must be
cut off think of the time wasted of—
mr brocklehurst was here interrupted  three
other visitors ladies now entered the room they
ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his
ιοι
jane eyre
lecture on dress for they were splendidly attired in
velvet silk and furs the two younger of the trio
fine girls of sixteen and seventeen had grey beaver
hats then in fashion shaded with ostrich plumes
and from under the brim of this graceful head dress
fell a profusion of light tresses elaborately curled 
the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl
trimmed with ermine and she wore a false front of
french curls
these ladies were deferentially received by miss
temple as mrs and misses brocklehurst and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room it
seems they had come in the carriage with their
reverend relative and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the rooms upstairs while he
transacted business with the housekeeper questioned
the laundress and lectured the superintendent
they now proceeded to address divers remarks and
reproofs to miss smith who was charged with the
care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories  but i had no time to listen to what they said 
other matters called off and enchained my attention
hitherto while gathering up the discourse of mr
brocklehurst and miss temple i had not at the
same time neglected precautions to secure my personal safety  which i thought would be effected if
i could only elude observation to this end i had
sat well back on the form and while seeming to be
busy with my sum had held my slate in such a
manner as to conceal my face  i might have escaped
102
jane eyre
notice had not my treacherous slate somehow
happened to slip from my hand and falling with an
obtrusive crash directly drawn every eye upon me 
i knew it was all over now and as i stooped to pick
up the two fragments of slate i rallied my forces
for the worst it came
a careless girl   said mr brocklehurst and immediately after  it is the new pupil i perceive
and before i could draw breath  i must not forget
i have a word to say respecting her then aloud
how loud it seemed to me   let the child who
broke her slate come forward  
of my own accord i could not have stirred  i
was paralyzed  but the two great girls who sat on
each side of me set me on my legs and pushed me
towards the dread judge and then miss temple
gently assisted me to his very feet and i caught her
whispered counsel —
dont be afraid jane i saw it was an accident 
you shall not be punished
the kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger
another minute and she will despise me for a
hypocrite  thought i  and an impulse of fury against
reed brocklehurst and co bounded in my pulses
at the conviction i was no helen burns
fetch that stool said mr brocklehurst pointing
to a very high one from which a monitor had just
risen it was brought
place the child upon it
and i was placed there by whom i dont know i
103
jane eyre
was in no condition to note particulars i was only
aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of
mr brocklehursts nose that he was within a yard of
me and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk
pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and
waved below me
mr brocklehurst hemmed
ladies said he turning to his family   miss
temple teachers and children you all see this
girl 
of course they did  for i felt their eyes directed
like burningglasses against my scorched skin
you see she is yet young  you observe she
possesses the ordinary form of childhood  god has
graciously given her the shape that he has given to
all of us  no single deformity points her out as a
marked character who would think that the evil
one had already found a servant and agent in her 
yet such i grieve to say is the case
a pausein which i began to steady the palsy of
my nerves and to feel that the rubicon was passed
and that the trial no longer to be shirked must be
firmly sustained
my dear children  pursued the black marble
clergyman with pathos  this is a sad a melancholy
occasion  for it becomes my duty to warn you that
this girl who might be one of gods own lambs is a
little castaway  not a member of the true flock but
evidently an interloper and an alien you must be
on your guard against her  you must shun her
104
jane eyre
converse
example  if necessary avoid her company exclude
her from your sports and shut her out from your
teachers you must watch her  keep
your eyes on her movements weigh well her words
scrutinize her actions punish her body to save her
soul  if indeed such salvation be possible for my
tongue falters while i tell it this girl this child the
native of a christian land worse than many a little
heathen who says its prayers to brahma and kneels
before juggernaut this girl is—a liar  ”
nowcame a pause of ten minutes  during which i
by this time in perfect possession of my witsobserved all the female brocklehursts produce their
pockethandkerchiefs and apply them to their optics
while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro
and the two younger ones whispered  how shocking 
mr brocklehurst resumed
this i learned from her benefactressfrom the
pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her
orphan state reared her as her own daughter and
whose kindness whose generosity the unhappy girl
repaid by an ingratitude so bad so dreadful that at
last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate
her from her own young ones fearful lest her vicious
example should contaminate their purity she has
sent her here to be healed even as the jews of old
sent their diseased to the troubled pool of bethesda 
and teachers superintendent i beg of you not to
allow the waters to stagnate round her 
105
jane eyre
with this sublime conclusion mr brocklehurst
adjusted the top button of his surtout muttered
something to his family who rose bowed to miss
temple and then all the great people sailed in state
from the room turning at the door my judge
said 
let her stand half an hour longer on that stool
and let no one speak to her during the remainder of
the day
there was i then mounted aloft  i who had
said i could not bear the shame of standing on my
natural feet in the middle of the room was now
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy
what my sensations were no language can describe 
but just as they all rose stifling my breath and constricting my throat a girl came up and passed me 
in passing she lifted her eyes what a strange
light inspired them  what an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me  how the new
feeling bore me up  it was as if a martyr a hero
had passed a slave or victim and imparted strength
in the transit i mastered the rising hysteria lifted
up my head and took a firm stand on the stool
helen burns asked some slight question about her
work of miss smith was chidden for the triviality of
the inquiry returned to her place and smiled at me
as she again went by what a smile  i remember
it now and i know that it was the effluence of fine
intellect of true courage  it lit up her marked
lineaments her thin face her sunken grey eye like
106
jane eyre
a reflection from the aspect of an angel yet at
that moment helen burns wore on her arm the
untidy badge   scarcely an hour ago i had heard
her condemned by miss scatcherd to a dinner of
bread and water on the morrow because she had
blotted an exercise in copying it out such is the
imperfect nature of man  such spots are there on
the disc of the clearest planet  and eyes like miss
scatcherds can only see those minute defects and
are blind to the full brightness of the orb
107
chapter viii
ere the half hour ended five oclock struck  school
was dismissed and all were gone into the refectory
to tea i now ventured to descend  it was deep
dusk  i retired into a corner and sat down on the
floor the spell by which i had been so far
supported began to dissolve  reaction took place
and soon so overwhelming was the grief that seized
me i sank prostrate with my face to the ground
now i wept helen burns was not here  nothing
sustained me  left to myself i abandoned myself
and my tears watered the boards i had meant to
be so good and to do so much at lowood  to make
so many friends to earn respect and win affection
already i had made visible progress  that very
morning i had reached the head of my class  miss
miller had praised me warmly  miss temple had
smiled approbation  she had promised to teach me
drawing and to let me learn french if i continued
to make similar improvement two months longer 
and then i was well received by my fellow pupils 
treated as an equal by those of my own age and
108
jane eyre
not molested by any  now here i lay again crushed
and trodden on  and could i ever rise more 
never i thought  and ardently i wished to die
while sobbing out this wish in broken accents some
one approached  i started up again helen burns
near me the fading fires just showed her
coming up the long vacant room  she brought me
coffee and bread
was
come eat something she said  but i put both
away from me feeling as if a drop or a crumb would
have choked me in my present condition helen
regarded me probably with surprise  i could not
now abate my agitation though i tried hard  i continued to weep aloud she sat down on the ground
near me embraced her knees with her arms and
rested her head upon them  in that attitude she
remained silent as an indian i was the first who
spoke
helen why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar  
everybody jane  why there are only eighty
people who have heard you called so and the world
contains hundreds of millions
 but what have i to do with millions  the
eighty i know despise me 
66 jane you are mistaken  probably not one in the
school either despises or dislikes you  many i am
sure pity you much 
 how can they pity me after what mr brocklehurst said  
109
jane eyre
 mr brocklehurst is not a god nor is he even a
great and admired man  he is little liked here  he
never took steps to make himself liked had he
treated you as an especial favourite you would have
found enemies declared or covert all around you 
as it is the greater number would offer you sympathy
if they dared teachers and pupils may look coldly
on you for a day or two but friendly feelings are
concealed in their hearts  and if you persevere in
doing well these feelings will ere long appear so
much the more evidently for their temporary
suppression besides jane she paused
well helen   said i putting myhand into hers
she chafed my fingers gently to warm them and
went on 
if all the world hated you and believed you
wicked while your own conscience approved you
and absolved you from guilt you would not be without friends 
no  i know i should think well of myself  but
that is not enough  if others dont love me i would
rather die than livei cannot bear to be solitary
and hated helen look here  to gain some real
affection from you or miss temple or any other
whom i truly love i would willingly submit to have
the bone of my arm broken or to let a bull toss me
or to stand behind a kicking horse and let it dash
its hoof at my chest 
hush jane  you think too much of the love of
human beings  you are too impulsive too vehement 
iio
jane eyre
the sovereign hand that created your frame and
put life into it has provided you with other resources than your feeble self or than creatures
feeble as you besides this earth and besides the
race of men there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits  that world is round us for it is
everywhere  and those spirits watch us for they are
commissioned to guard us  and if we were dying in
pain and shame if scorn smote us on all sides and
hatred crushed us angels see our tortures recognize
our innocence if innocent we be  as i know you are
of this charge which mr brocklehurst has weakly
and pompously repeated at secondhand from mrs
reed  for i read a sincere nature in your ardent
eyes and on your clear front  and god waits only
the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a
full reward why then should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress when life is so soon over
and death is so certain an entrance to happinessto
glory  
i was silent  helen had calmed me  but in the
tranquillity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness i felt the impression of woe as
she spoke but i could not tell whence it came  and
when having done speaking she breathed a little
fast and coughed a short cough i momentarily
forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern
for her
resting my head on helens shoulder i put my
arms round her waist  she drew me to her and we
iii
jane eyre
reposed in silence we had not sat long thus when
another person came in some heavy clouds swept
from the sky by a rising wind had left the moon
bare  and her light streaming in through a window
near shone full both on us and on the approaching
figure which we at once recognized as miss temple
i came on purpose to find you jane eyre said
she   i want you in my room  and as helen burns
is with you she may come too 
wewent  following the superintendents guidance
we had to thread some intricate passages and mount
a staircase before we reached her apartment  it
contained a good fire and looked cheerful miss
temple told helen burns to be seated in a low armchair on one side of the hearth and herself taking
another she called me to her side
is it all over   she asked looking down at my
face have you cried your grief away  
 i am afraid i never shall do that ”
፡፡ why
because i have been wrongly accused  and you
maʼam and everybody else will now think me
wicked 
we shall think you what you prove yourself to
be my child continue to act as a good girl and
you will satisfy us 
shall i miss temple
 you will said she passing her arms round me
and now tell me who is the lady whommr brocklehurst called your benefactress 
112
jane eyre
mrs reed my uncles wife my uncle is dead
and he left me to her care 
did she not then adopt you of her own
accord 
66 no maam  she was sorry to have to do it  but
my uncle as i have often heard the servants say got
her to promise before he died that she would always
keep me
well now jane you know or at least i will tell
you that when a criminal is accused he is always
allowed to speak in his own defence you have
been charged with falsehood  defend yourself to me
as well as you can say whatever your memory
suggests as true  but add nothing and exaggerate
nothing 
i resolved in the depth of my heart that i would
be most moderatemost correct  and having
reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what i had to say i told her all the story of
my sad childhood exhausted by emotion my
language was more subdued than it generally was
when it developed that sad theme  and mindful of
helens warnings against the indulgence of resentment i infused into the narrative far less of gall and
wormwood than ordinary thus restrained and
simplified it sounded more credible  i felt as i went
on that miss temple fully believed me
in the course of the tale i had mentioned mr
lloyd as having come to see me after the fit  for i
never forget the to me frightful episode of the red113 i
jane eyre
room  in detailing which my excitement was sure in
some degree to break bounds  for nothing could
soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which
clutched my heart when mrs reed spurned my wild
supplication for pardon and locked me a second
time in the dark and haunted chamber
i had finished miss temple regarded me a few
minutes in silence  she then said 
 i know something of mr lloyd  i shall write to
him  if his reply agrees with your statement you
shall be publicly cleared from every imputation  to
me jane you are clear now
she kissed me and still keeping me at her side
where i was well contented to stand for i derived a
childs pleasure from the contemplation of her face
her dress her one or two ornaments her white forehead her clustered and shining curls and beaming
dark eyes she proceeded to address helen burns
how are you tonight helen  have you
coughed much today  
not quite so much i think maʼam ”
and the pain in your chest  
it is a little better
miss temple got up took her and examined her
pulse  then she returned to her own seat  as she
resumed it i heard her sigh low she was pensive a
few minutes then rousing herself she said cheerfully 
but you two are my visitors tonight  i must
treat you as such  she rang her bell
114
jane eyre
barbara she said to the servant who answered
it  i have not yet had tea  bring the tray and place
cups for these two young ladies 
and a tray was soon brought how pretty to my
eyes did the china cups and bright teapot look
placed on the little round table near the fire  how
fragrant was the steam of the beverage and the
scent of the toast  of which however i to my
dismay for i was beginning to be hungry discerned only a very small portion  miss temple
discerned it too 
barbara said she  can you not bring alittle
more bread and butter  there is not enough for
three 
barbara went out  she returned soon 
 madam mrs harden says she has sent up the
usual quantity
mrs harden be it observed was the housekeeper
a woman after mr brocklehursts own heart made
up of equal parts ofwhalebone and iron
oh very well  returned miss temple   we
must make it do barbara i suppose and as the girl
withdrew she added smiling  fortunately i have
it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once 
having invited helen and me to approach the
table and placed before each of us a cup of tea with
one delicious but thin morsel of toast she got up
unlocked a drawer and taking from it a parcel
wrapped in paper disclosed presently to our eyes a
good sized seed cake
115
jane eyre
i meant to give each of you some of this to take
with you said she   but as there is so little toast
you must have it now and she proceeded to cut
slices with a generous hand
we feasted that evening as on nectar and
ambrosia  and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our
hostess regarded us as we satisfied our famished
appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied
tea over and the tray removed she again summoned
us to the fire  we sat one on each side of her and
now a conversation followed between her and helen
which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to
hear
miss temple had always something of serenity in
her air of state in her mien of refined propriety in
her language which precluded deviation into the
ardent the excited the eager  something which
chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her
and listened to her by a controlling sense of awe 
and such was my feeling now  but as to helen
burns i was struck with wonder
the refreshing meal the brilliant fire the presence
and kindness of her beloved instructress or perhaps
more than all these something in her own unique
mind had roused her powers within her they
woke they kindled  first they glowed in the bright
tint of her cheek which till this hour i had never
seen but pale and bloodless  then they shone in
the liquid lustre of her eyes which had suddenly
116
jane eyre
acquired a beauty more singular than that of miss
temples a beauty neither of fine colour nor long
eyelash nor pencilled brow but of meaning ofmovement of radiance then her soul sat on her lips
and language flowed from what source i cannot tell 
has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough vigorous
enough to hold the swelling spring of pure full
fervid eloquence  such was the characteristic of
helens discourse on that to me memorable
evening  her spirit seemed hastening to live within
a very brief span as much as many live during a
protracted existence
they conversed of things i had never heard of  of
nations and times past  of countries far away  of
secrets of nature discovered or guessed at  they
spoke of books  how many they had read  what
stores of knowledge they possessed  then they
seemed so familiar with french names and french
authors  but my amazement reached its climax when
miss temple asked helen if she sometimes snatched
a moment to recall the latin her father had taught
her and taking a book from a shelf bade her read
and construe a page of virgil  and helen obeyed
my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line she had scarcely finished ere the bell
announced bedtime  no delay could be admitted 
miss temple embraced us both saying as she drew
us to her heart—
god bless you my children  
helen she held a little longer than me  she let her
117
jane eyre
go more reluctantly it was helen her eye followed
to the door  it was for her she a second time
breathed a sad sigh  for her she wiped a tear from
her cheek
on reaching the bedroom we heard the voice of
miss scatcherd  she was examining drawers  she
had just pulled out helen burnss and when we
entered helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand
and told that tomorrow she should have half a
dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
shoulder
my things were indeed in shameful disorder
murmured helen to me in a low voice i intended
to have arranged them but i forgot 

next morning miss scatcherd wrote in conspicuous
characters on a piece of pasteboard the word
slattern and bound it like a phylactery round
helens large mild intelligent and benignlooking
forehead she wore it till evening patient unresentful regarding it as a deserved punishment the
moment miss scatcherd withdrew after afternoon
school i ran to helen tore it off and thrust it into
the fire the fury of which she was incapable had
been burning in my soul all day and tears hot and
large had continually been scalding my cheek  for
the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an
intolerable pain at the heart
about a week subsequently to the incidents above
narrated miss temple who had written to mr
lloyd received his answer  it appeared that what
118
jane eyre
he said went to corroborate my account miss
temple having assembled the whole school
announced that inquiry had been made into the
charges alleged against jane eyre and that she was
most happy to be able to pronounce her completely
cleared from every imputation the teachers then
shook hands with me and kissed me and a murmur
of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions
thus relieved of a grievous load i from that hour
set to work afresh resolved to pioneer my way
through every difficulty i toiled hard and my
success was proportionate to my efforts  my memory
not naturally tenacious improved with practice 
exercise sharpened my wits in a few weeks i was
promoted to a higher class  in less than two months
i was allowed to commence french and drawing i
learned the first two tenses of the verb etre and
sketched my first cottage whose walls by the way
outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of
pisa  on the same day that night on going to
bed i forgot to prepare in imagination the barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes or white bread
and new milk with which i was wont to amuse my
inward cravings i feasted instead on the spectacle
of ideal drawings which i saw in the darkall the
work of my own hands  freely pencilled houses and
trees picturesque rocks and ruins cuyplike groups
of cattle sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over
unblown roses of birds picking at ripe cherries of
119
jane eyre
wrens nests enclosing pearllike eggs wreathed
about with young ivy sprays i examined too in
thought the possibility of my ever being able to
translate currently a certain little french storybook
which madame pierrot had that day shown me  nor
was that problem solved to my satisfaction ere i fell
sweetly asleep
well has solomon said better is a dinner of
herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred
therewith 
i would not now have exchanged lowood with all
its privations for gateshead and its daily luxuries
i 20
chapter ix
but the privations or rather the hardships of
lowood lessened spring drew onshe was indeed
already come  the frosts of winter had ceased  its
snows were melted its cutting winds ameliorated
my wretched feet flayed and swollen to lameness by
the sharp air of january began to heal and subside
under the gentler breathings of april  the nights
and mornings no longer by their canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins  we could
now endure the playhour passed in the garden 
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be
pleasant and genial and a greenness grewover those
brown beds which freshening daily suggested the
thought that hope traversed them at night and left
each morning brighter traces of her steps flowers
peeped out amongst the leaves  snowdrops crocuses
purple auriculas and golden eyed pansies on
thursday afternoons halfholidays we now took
walks and found still sweeter flowers opening by
the wayside under the hedges
i discovered too that a great pleasure an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded lay all out121

side the high and spikeguarded walls ofour garden 
this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits
girdling a great hillhollow rich in verdure and
shadow  in a bright beck full of dark stones and
sparkling eddies how different had this scene
looked when i viewed it laid out beneath the iron
sky ofwinter stiffened in frost shrouded with snow 
when mists as chill as death wandered to the
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks and
rolled down  ing  and holm till they blended with
the frozen fog of the beck  that beck itself was
then a torrent turbid and curbless  it tore asunder
the wood and sent a raving sound through the air
often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet 
and for the forest on its banks that showed only
ranks of skeletons
april advanced to may  a bright serene may it
was  days of blue sky placid sunshine and soft
western or southern gales filled up its duration
and now vegetation matured with vigour  lowood
shook loose its tresses  it became all green all
flowery  its great elm ash and oak skeletons were
restored to majestic life  woodland plants sprang
up profusely in its recesses  unnumbered varieties
of moss filled its hollows and it made a strange
ground sunshine out of the wealth of its wild
primrose plants  i have seen their pale gold
gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of
the sweetest lustre all this i enjoyed often and
fully free unwatched and almost alone  for this
122
jane eyre
unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause to
which it now becomes my task to advert
have i not described a pleasant site for a dwelling when i speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood
and rising from the verge of a stream assuredly
pleasant enough but whether healthy or not is
another question
that forest dell where lowood lay was the
cradle of fog and fogbred pestilence  which
quickening with the quickening spring crept into
the orphan asylum breathed typhus through its
crowded schoolroom and dormitory and ere may
arrived transformed the seminary into a hospital
semistarvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection 
fortyfive out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time
classes were broken up rules relaxed the few
who continued well were allowed almost unlimited
licence because the medical attendant insisted on
the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in
health and had it been otherwise no one had leisure
to watch or restrain them miss temples whole
attention was absorbed by the patients  she lived in
the sickroom never quitting it except to snatch a
few hours rest at night the teachers were fully
occupied with packing up and making other
necessary preparations for the departure of those
girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and
relations able and willing to remove them from the
seat of contagion many already smitten went
123
jane eyre
home only to die  some died at the school and
were buried quietly and quickly the nature of the
malady forbidding delay
while disease had thus become an inhabitant or
lowood and death its frequent visitor  while there
was gloom and fear within its walls  while its rooms
and passages steamed with hospital smells the drug
and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the
effluvia of mortality that bright may shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland
out of doors its garden too glowed with flowers 
hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees lilies had
opened tulips and roses were in bloom  the borders
of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and
crimson doubledaisies  the sweetbriars gave out
morning and evening their scent of spice and
apples  and these fragrant treasures were all useless
for most of the inmates of lowood except to furnish
now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to
put in a coffin
but i and the rest who continued well enjoyed
fully the beauties of the scene and season  they let
us ramble in the wood like gipsies from morning till
night  we did what we liked went where we liked 
we lived better too mr brocklehurst and his
family never came near lowood now  household
matters were not scrutinized into  the cross housekeeper was gone driven away by the fear of infection  her successor who had been matron at the
lowton dispensary unused to the ways of her
124
jane eyre
new abode provided with comparative liberality
besides there were fewer to feed  the sick could
eat little  our breakfastbasins were better filled 
when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner
which often happened she would give us a large
piece of cold pie or a thick slice of bread and
cheese and this we carried away with us to the
wood where we each chose the spot we liked best
and dined sumptuously
my favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone
rising white and dry from the very middle of the
beck and only to be got at by wading through the
water a feat i accomplished barefoot the stone
was just broad enough to accommodate comfortably
another girl and me at that time my chosen
comradeone mary ann wilson  a shrewd observant personage whose society i took pleasure in
partly because she was witty and original and partly
because she had a manner which set me at my ease
some years older than i she knew more of the
world and could tell me many things i liked to
hear  with her my curiosity found gratification  to
my faults also she gave ample indulgence never
imposing curb or rein on anything i said she had
a turn for narrative i for analysis  she liked to
inform i to question  so we got on swimmingly
together deriving much entertainment if not much
improvement from our mutual intercourse
and where meantime was helen burns  why
did i not spend these sweet days of liberty with
125
jane eyre
her had i forgotten her  or was i so worthless as
to have grown tired of her pure society  surely the
mary ann wilson i have mentioned was inferior to
my first acquaintance  she could only tell me
amusing stories and reciprocate any racy and
pungent gossip i chose to indulge in  while if i
have spoken truth of helen she was qualified to
give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse
a taste of far higher things
true reader  and i knew and felt this  and
though i am a defective being with many faults and
few redeeming points yet i never tired of helen
burns nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of attachment as strong tender and respectful as any that ever animated my heart how could
it be otherwise when helen at all times and under
all circumstances evinced for me a quiet and
faithful friendship which illhumour never soured
nor irritation ever troubled  but helen was ill at
present  for some weeks she had been removed
from my sight to i knew not what room upstairs
she was not i was told in the hospital portion
of the house with the fever patients  for her
complaint was consumption not typhus  and by
consumption i in my ignorance understood something mild which time and care would be sure to
alleviate
i was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once
or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny
afternoons and being taken by miss temple into the
126
jane eyre
garden  but on these occasions i was not allowed to
go and speak to her  i only saw her from the schoolroom window and then not distinctly  for she was
much wrapped up and sat at a distance under the
verandah
one evening in the beginning of june i had stayed
out very late with mary ann in the wood  we had
as usual separated ourselves from the others and
had wandered far  so far that we lost our way and
had to ask it at a lonely cottage where a man and
woman lived who looked after a herd of half wild
swine that fed on the mast in the wood when we
got back it was after moonrise  a pony which we
knew to be the surgeons was standing at the garden
door mary ann remarked that she supposed some
one must be very ill  as mr bates had been sent for at
that time of the evening she went into the house  i
stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden
a handful of roots i had dug up in the forest and
which i feared would wither if i left them till the
morning this done i lingered yet a little longer 
the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell  it was
such a pleasant evening so serene so warm  the still
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on
the morrow  the moon rose with such majesty in the
grave east i was noting these things and enjoying
them as a child might when it entered my mind as it
had never done before 
how sad to be lying on a sick bed and to be in
danger of dying  this world is pleasantit would
127
jane eyre
be dreary to be called from it and to have to go who
knows where 
and then my mind made its first earnest effort to
comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell  and for the first time it recoiled baffled  and for the first time glancing
behind on each side and before it it saw all round
an unfathomed gulf  it felt the one point where it
stood the present  all the rest was formless cloud
and vacant depth  and it shuddered at the thought
of tottering and plunging amid that chaos while
pondering this new idea i heard the front door open 
mr bates came out and with him was a nurse
after she had seen him mount his horse and depart
she was about to close the door but i ran up to her
how is helen burns 
66 very poorly was the answer
 is it she mr bates has been to see 
yes
and what does he say about her  
he says shell not be here long 
this phrase uttered in my hearing yesterday
would have only conveyed the notion that she was
about to be removed to northumberland to her own
home i should not have suspected that it meant she
was dying  but i knewinstantly now  it opened clear
on my comprehension that helen burns was numbering her last days in this world and that she was
going to be taken to the region of spirits if such
region there were i experienced a shock of horror
128
jane eyre
then a strong thrill of grief then a desirea
necessity to see her  and i asked in what room
she lay
she is in miss temples room said the nurse
may i go up and speak to her  
 oh no child  it is not likely  and now it is
time for you to come in  youll catch the fever if you
stop out when the dew is falling 
the nurse closed the front door  i went in by the
side entrance which led to the schoolroom  i was
just in time  it was nine oclock and miss miller
was calling the pupils to go to bed
it might be two hours later probably near eleven
when i not having been able to fall asleep and
deeming from the perfect silence of the dormitory
that my companions were all wrapt in profound reposerose softly put on my frock over my nightdress and without shoes crept from the apartment
and set off in quest of miss temples room
it was
quite at the other end of the house  but i knew my
way  and the light of the unclouded summer moon
entering here and there at passage windows enabled
me to find it without difficulty an odour of
camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when i came
near the feverroom and i passed its door quickly
fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should
hear me i dreaded being discovered and sent back 
for i must see helen i must embrace her before
she died i must give her one last kiss exchange
with her one last word
129 k
jane eyre
having descended a staircase traversed a portion
of the house below and succeeded in opening and
shutting without noise two doors i reached another
flight of steps  these i mounted and then just
opposite to me was miss temples room a light
shone through the keyhole and from under the
door  a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity
coming near i found the door slightly ajar  probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode
of sickness indisposed to hesitate and full of impatient impulsessoul and senses quivering with
keen throesi put it back and looked in my eye
sought helen and feared to find death
close by miss temples bed and half covered with
its white curtains there stood a little crib i saw
the outline of a form under the clothes but the face
was hid by the hangings  the nurse i had spoken to
in the garden sat in an easy chair asleep  an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table miss
temple was not to be seen  i knew afterwards that
she had been called to a delirious person in the feverroom i advanced  then paused by the crib side 
my hand was on the curtain but i preferred speaking before i withdrew it i still recoiled at the
dread of seeing a corpse
helen   i whispered softly   are you awake  
she stirred herself put back the curtain and i
saw her face pale wasted but quite composed  she
looked so little changed that my fear was instantly
dissipated
130
jane eyre
can it be you jane   she asked in her own
gentle voice
oh   i thought she is not going to die  they
are mistaken  she could not speak and look so
calmly if she were 
i got on to her crib and kissed her  her forehead
was cold and her cheek both cold and thin and so
were her hand and wrist  but she smiled as of old
why are you come here jane  it is past eleven
oclock  i heard it strike some minutes since 
i came to see you helen  i heard you were
very ill and i could not sleep till i had spoken to
you 
you came to bid me goodbye then you arejust
in time probably 
are you going somewhere helen  are you
going home
yes  to my long homemy last home
no no helen   i stopped distressed while
i tried to devour my tears a fit of coughing seized
helen  it did not however wake the nurse  when
it was over she lay some minutes exhausted  then
she whispered —
jane your little feet are bare  lie down and
cover yourself with my quilt
i did so she put her arm over me and i nestled
close to her after a long silence she resumed
still whispering —
 i am very happy jane  and when you hear that
i am dead you must be sure and not grieve  there
131
jane eyre
is nothing to grieve about we all must die one
day and the illness which is removing me is not
painful  it is gentle and gradual  my mind is at
rest i leave no one to regret me much  i have
only a father  and he is lately married and will not
miss me
by dying young i shall escape great
sufferings i had not qualities or talents to make
my way very well in the world  i should have been
continually at fault
but where are you going to helen  can you
see  do you know  
 i believe  i have faith  i am going to god  
where is god what is god 
my maker and yours who will never destroy
what he created i rely implicitly on his power and
confide wholly in his goodness
 i count the hours
till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me
to him reveal him to me 
you are sure then helen that there is such a
place as heaven  and that our souls can get to it
when we die  
i am sure there is a future state  i believe god
is good  i can resign my immortal part to him without any misgiving god is my father  god is my
friend  i love him i believe he loves me 
 and shall i see you again helen when i
die 
you will come to the same region of happiness 
be received by the same mighty universal parent no
doubt dear jane 
་132
jane eyre
again i questioned  but this time only in thought
where is that region  does it exist   and i
clasped my arms closer round helen  she seemed
dearer to me than ever  i felt as if i could not let
her go  i lay with my face hidden on her neck
presently she said in the sweetest tone 
how comfortable i am  that last fit of coughing has tired me a little  i feel as if i could sleep 
but dont leave me jane  i like to have you near
me 
 ill stay with you dear helen  no one shall take
me away
 are you warm darling  
yes
goodnight jane
66goodnight helen 
she kissed me and i her  and we both soon
slumbered
when i awoke it was day  an unusual movement
roused me  i looked up  i was in somebodys arms 
the nurse held me  she was carrying me through the
passage back to the dormitory i was not reprimanded for leaving my bed  people had something
else to think about  no explanation was afforded
then to my many questions  but a day or two afterwards i learned that miss temple on returning to
her own room at dawn had found me laid in the
little crib  my face against helen burnss shoulder
my arms round her neck i was asleep and helen
was dead
133
jane eyre
her grave is in brocklebridge churchyard  for
fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a
grassy mound  but now a grey marble tablet marks
the spot inscribed with her name and the word
resurgam 
134
chapter x
hitherto i have recorded in detail the events of my
insignificant existence  to the first ten years of my
life i have given almost as many chapters but this
is not to be a regular autobiography  i am only
bound to invoke memory where i know her responses
will possess some degree of interest  therefore i now
pass a space of eight years almost in silence  a few
lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
connection
when the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of
devastation at lowood it gradually disappeared from
there  but not till its virulence and the number of
its victims had drawn public attention on the school
inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge
and by degrees various facts came out which excited
public indignation in a high degree the unhealthy
nature of the site  the quantity and quality of the
childrens food  the brackish fetid water used in its
preparation  the pupils wretched clothing and
accommodationsall these things were discovered 
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to
mr brocklehurst but beneficial to the institution
135
jane eyre
several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the
county subscribed largely for the erection of a more
convenient building in a better situation  new regulations were made  improvements in diet and
clothing introduced  the funds of the school were
entrusted to the management of a committee mr
brocklehurst who from his wealth and family connections could not be overlooked still retained the
post of treasurer  but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more
enlarged and sympathizing minds  his office of
inspector too was shared by those who knew how
to combine reason with strictness comfort with
economy compassion with uprightness the school
thus improved became in time a truly useful and
noble institution i remained an inmate of its walls
after its regeneration for eight yearssix as pupil
and two as teacher  and in both capacities i bear
my testimony to its value and importance
during these eight years mylife was uniform but
not unhappy because it was not inactive i had the
means of an excellent education placed within my
reach  a fondness for some of my studies and a
desire to excel in all together with a great delight
in pleasing my teachers especially such as i loved
urged me on  i availed myself fully of the advantages offered me in time i rose to be the first girl
of the first class  then i was invested with the office
of teacher  which i discharged with zeal for two
years  but at the end of that time i altered
136
jane eyre
miss temple through all changes had thus far
continued superintendent of the seminary  to her
instruction i owed the best part ofmy acquirements 
her friendship and society had been my continual
solace  she had stood me in the stead of mother
governess and latterly companion at this period
she married removed with her husband a clergyman
an excellent man almost worthy of such a wife to a
distant county and consequently was lost to me
from the day she left i was no longer the same 
with her was gone every settled feeling every association that had made lowood in some degree a
home to me i had imbibed from her something
of her nature and much of her habits  more harmonious thoughts  what seemed better regulated
feelings had become the inmates of my mind i had
given in allegiance to duty and order  i was quiet 
i believed i was content  to the eyes of others
usually even to my own i appeared a disciplined
and subdued character
but destiny in the shape of the rev mr nasmyth
came between me and miss temple  i saw her in
her travelling dress step into a postchaise shortly
after the marriage ceremony i watched the chaise
mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow and
then retired to my own room and there spent in
solitude the greatest part of the halfholiday granted
in honour of the occasion
i walked about the chamber most of the time i
imagined myself only to be regretting my loss and
137
jane eyre
thinking how to repair it  but when my reflections
were concluded and i looked up and found that the
afternoon was gone and evening far advanced
another discovery dawned on menamely that in
the interval i had undergone a transforming process 
that my mind had put off all it had borrowed ofmiss
temple or rather that she had taken with her the
serene atmosphere i had been breathing in her
vicinity and that now i was left in my natural
element and beginning to feel the stirring of old
emotions it did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn but rather as if a motive were gone  it was
not the power to be tranquil which had failed me
but the reason for tranquillity was no more my
world had for some years been in lowood  my
experience had been of its rules and systems  now i
remembered that the real world was wide and that
a varied field of hopes and fears of sensations and
excitements awaited those who had courage to go
forth into its expanse to seek real knowledge of life
amidst its perils
i went to my window opened it and looked out
there were the two wings of the building  there was
the garden  there were the skirts of lowood  there
was the hilly horizon my eye passed all other
objects to rest on those most remote the blue peaks
it was those i longed to surmount  all within their
boundary of rock and heath seemed prisonground
exile limits i traced the white road winding round
the base of one mountain and vanishing in a gorge
1138
jane eyre
between two how i longed to follow it further  i
recalled the time when i had travelled that veryroad
in a coach  i remembered
descending
that hill at
twilight
 an age seemed
to have elapsed
since the
day which
brought
me first to lowood
 and i had
never quitted
it since my vacations
had all been
spent at school  mrs reed had never sent for me
to gateshead
 neither
she nor any of her family
had
ever been to visit me i had had no communication
by letter or message
with the outer world school
rules school
duties school
habits and notions
 and
voices and faces and phrases
 and costumes
 and
preferences
 and antipathies
 such was what i knew
of existence
 and now i felt that it was not enough

i tired ofthe routine
of eight years in one afternoon

i desired
liberty  for liberty i gasped
 for liberty i
uttered
a prayer
 it seemed
scattered
on the wind
then faintly blowing
 i abandoned
it and framed
a
humbler
supplication
 for change stimulus
 that
petition
 too seemed
swept
off into vague space
 then i cried half desperate
 grant me at least a
new servitude
 
here a bell ringing the hour of supper called me
downstairs
i was not free to resume the interrupted chain of
my reflections till bedtime  even then a teacher who
occupied the same room with me kept me from the
subject to which i longed to recur by a prolonged
effusion of small talk how i wished sleep would
silence her  it seemed as if could i but go back to
139
jane eyre
the idea which had last entered my mind as i stood
at the window some inventive suggestion would rise
for my relief
miss gryce snored at last  she was a heavy
welshwoman and till now her habitual nasal strains
had never been regarded by me in any other light
than as a nuisance tonight i hailed the first
deep notes with satisfaction  i was debarrassed
of interruption  my halfeffaced thought instantly
revived
a new servitude  there is something in that
i soliloquized mentally be it understood  i did not
talk aloud   i know there is because it does not
sound too sweet it is not like such words as
liberty excitement enjoyment  delightful sounds
truly but no more than sounds for me and so
hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time
to listen to them but servitude  that must be
matter of fact any one may serve  i have served
here eight years  all now i want is to serve elsewhere can i not get so much of my own will  is
not the thing feasible  yesyesthe end is not
difficult  if i had only a brain active enoughto ferret
out the means of attaining it 
i sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain
it was a chilly night  i covered my shoulders with a
shawl and then i proceeded to think again with all
my might
what do i want  a new place in a new house
amongst new faces under new circumstances  i
140
jane eyre

want this because it is of no use wanting anything
better how do people do to get a new place 
they apply to friends i suppose i have no friends
there are many others who have no friends who
must look about for themselves and be their own
helpers  and what is their resource  
i could not tell nothing answered me i then
ordered my brain to find a response and quickly it
worked and worked faster  i felt the pulses throb in
my head and temples  but for nearly an hour it
worked in chaos and no result came of its efforts
feverish with vain labour i got up and took a turn
in the room  undrewthe curtain noted a star or two
shivered with cold and again crept to bed
a kind fairy in my absence had surely dropped
the required suggestion on my pillow for as i lay
down it came quietly and naturally to my mind —
those who want situations advertise  you must
advertise in theshire herald
how i know nothing about advertising 
replies rose smooth and prompt now
you must enclose the advertisement and the
money to pay for it under a cover directed to the
editor of the herald you must put it the first
opportunity you have into the post at lowton
answers must be addressed to j e at the post office
there you can go and inquire in about a week
after you send your letter if any are come and act
accordingly 
this scheme i went over twice thrice  it was then
141
jane eyre
digested in my mind i had it in a clear practical
form  i felt satisfied and fell asleep
with earliest day i was up  i had my advertisement written enclosed and directed before the bell
rang to rouse the school  it ran thus —
“a young lady accustomed to tuition  had i not
been a teacher two years   is desirous of meeting
with a situation in a private family where the
children are under fourteen  i thought that as i
was barely eighteen it would not do to undertake
the guidance of pupils nearer my own age  she is
qualified to teach the usual branches of a good
english education together with french drawing
and music  in those days reader this now narrow
catalogue of accomplishments would have been held
tolerably comprehensive  address j e  post
office lowton shire 
this document remained locked in my drawer all
day after tea i asked leave of the new superintendent to go to lowton in order to perform some
small commissions for myself and one or two of my
fellowteachers  permission was readily granted  i
went it was a walk of two miles and the evening
was wet but the days were still long  i visited a shop
or two slipped the letter into the postoffice and
came back through heavy rain with streaming
garments but with a relieved heart
the succeeding week seemed long  it came to an
end at last however like all sublunary things and
once more towards the close of a pleasant autumn
142
jane eyre
day i found myself afoot on the road to lowton a
picturesque track it was by the way  lying along
the side ofthe beck and through the sweetest curves
ofthe dale  but that day i thought more ofthe letters
that might or might not be awaiting me at the
little burgh whither i was bound than of the charms
of lea and water
my ostensible errand on this occasion was to get
measured for a pair of shoes  so i discharged that
business first and when it was done i stepped across
the clean and quiet little street from the shoemakers
to the postoffice  it was kept by an old dame who
wore horn spectacles on her nose and black mittens
on her hands
are there any letters for j e   i asked
she peered at me over her spectacles and then
she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents
for a long time so long that my hopes began to
falter at last having held a document before her
glasses for nearly five minutes she presented it across
the counter accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for j e
 is there only one   i demanded
there are no more said she  and i put it in
my pocket and turned my face homeward  i could
not open it then  rules obliged me to be back by
eight and it was already half past seven
various duties awaited me on my arrival i had
to sit with the girls during their hour of study 
then it was my turn to read prayers  to see them to
143
jane eyre
bed  afterwards i supped with the other teachers
even when we finally retired for the night the
inevitable miss gryce was still my companion  we
had only a short end of candle in our candlestick
and i dreaded lest she should talk till it was all
burnt out  fortunately however the heavy supper
she had eaten produced a soporific effect  she was
already snoring before i had finished undressing
there still remained an inch of candle  i now took
out my letter  the seal was an initial f i broke it 
the contents were brief
 if j e  who advertised in theshire herald
of last thursday possesses the acquirements mentioned  and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency 
a situation can be offered her where there is but one
pupil a little girl under ten years of age  and
where the salary is thirty pounds per annum j e
is requested to send references name address and
all particulars to the directionmrs fairfax
thornfield near millcote shire 
i examined the document long  the writing was
old fashioned and rather uncertain like that of an
elderly lady this circumstance was satisfactory 
a private fear had haunted me that in thus acting
for myself and by my own guidance i ran the risk
of getting into some scrape  and above all things
i wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable proper en règle i now felt that an elderly
lady was no bad ingredient in the business i had on
144
jane eyre
hand mrs fairfax  i saw her in a black gown and
widows cap  frigid perhaps but not uncivil  a
model of elderly english respectability thornfield 
that doubtless was the name of her house  a neat
orderly spot i was sure  though i failed in my
efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises
millcote shire  i brushed up my recollections of
the map of england  yes i saw it  both the shire
and the town shire was seventy miles nearer
london than the remote county where i now
resided that was a recommendation to me i
longed to go where there was life and movement 
millcote was a large manufacturing town on the
banks ofthe a  a busy place enough doubtless 
so much the better  it would be a complete change
at least not that my fancy was much captivated
by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke
but i argued thornfield will probably be a
good way from the town ”
here the socket of the candle dropped and the
wick went out
next day new steps were to be taken  my plans
could no longer be confined to my own breast  i
must impart them in order to achieve their success
having sought and obtained an audience of the
superintendent during the noontide recreation i
told her i had a prospect of getting a new situation
where the salary would be double what i now
received for at lowood i only got £15 per annum 
and requested that she would break the matter for
145 l
jane eyre
1me to mr brocklehurst or some of the committee
and ascertain whether they would permit me to
mention them as references she obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter the next
day she laid the affair before mr brocklehurst who
said that mrs reed must be written to as she was
my natural guardian a note was accordingly
addressed to that lady who returned for an answer
that  i might do as i pleased  she had long
relinquished all interference in my affairs  this
note went the round of the committee and at last
after what appeared to be most tedious delay
formal leave was given me to better my condition if
i could and an assurance added that as i had
always conducted myself well both as teacher and
pupil at lowood a testimonial of character and
capacity signed by the inspectors of that institution
should forthwith be furnished me
this testimonial i accordingly received in about
a month forwarded a copy of it to mrs fairfax and
got that ladys reply stating that she was satisfied 
and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
assuming the post of governess in her house
i now busied myself in preparations  the fortnight passed rapidly i had not a very large wardrobe though it was adequate to my wants  and
the last day sufficed to pack my trunkthe same
i had brought with me eight years ago from gateshead
the box was corded the card nailed on in half

an hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to
lowton whither i myself was to repair at an early
hour the next morning to meet the coach i had
brushed my black stuff travelling dress prepared
my bonnet gloves and muff  sought in all my
drawers to see that no article was left behind  and
now having nothing more to do i sat down and
tried to rest i could not  though i had been on
foot all day i could not now repose an instant  i
was too much excited a phase of my life was
closing tonight a new one opening tomorrow 
impossible to slumber in the interval  i must
watch feverishly while the change was being
accomplished
miss said a servant who met me in the lobby
where i was wandering like a troubled spirit a
person below wishes to see you 
the carrier no doubt i thought and ran
dowstairs without inquiry i was passing the back
parlour or teachers sittingroom the door of which
was half open to go to the kitchen when some one
ran out 
 its her i am sure i could have told her
anywhere   cried the individual who stopped my
progress and took my hand
i looked  i saw a woman attired like a welldressed servant matronly yet still young  very
good looking with black hair and eyes and lively
complexion
“ well who is it  ” she asked in a voice and with
147
jane eyre
a smile i half recognized   youve not quite for
gotten me i think miss jane  
in another second i was embracing and kissing
her rapturously  bessie  bessie  bessie   that
was all i said  whereat she half laughed half cried
and we both went into the parlour by the fire
stood a little fellow of three years old in plaid frock
and trousers
that is my little boy said bessie directly
then you are married bessie  
yes  nearly five years since to robert leaven
the coachman  and ive a little girl besides bobby
there that ive christened jane
and you dont live at gateshead  
i live at the lodge  the old porter has left 
well and how do they all get on  tell me
everything about them bessie  but sit down first 
and bobby come and sit on my knee will you 
but bobby preferred sidling over to his mother
 youre not grown so very tall miss jane nor so
very stout continued mrs leaven  i dare say
theyve not kept you too well at school  miss reed
is the head and shoulders taller than you are  and
miss georgiana would make two of you in breadth 
georgiana is handsome i suppose bessie  
very she went up to london last winter with
her mamma and there everybody admired her and
a young lord fell in love with her but his relations
were against the match  and what do you think 
he and miss georgiana made it up to run away 
148
jane eyre
but they were found out and stopped it was miss
reed that found them out  i believe she was
envious  and now she and her sister lead a cat anddog life together  they are always quarrelling 
66 well and what of john reed 
oh he is not doing so well as his mamma could
wish he went to college and he gotplucked i
think they call it and then his uncles wanted him
to be a barrister and study the law  but he is such
a dissipated young man they will never make much
of him i think 
what does he look like 
he is very tall some people call him a finelooking young man  but he has such thick lips
and mrs reed 
missis looks stout and well enough in the face
but i think shes not quite easy in her mind mr
johns conduct does not please her he spends a
deal of money 
did she send you here bessie  
no indeed  but i have long wanted to see you
and when i heard that there had been a letter from
you and that you were going to another part of the
country i thought id just set off and get a look at
you before you were quite out of my reach 
“ i am afraid you are disappointed in me bessie  
i said this laughing i perceived that bessies
glance though it expressed regard did in no shape
denote admiration
 no miss jane not exactly you are genteel
149
jane eyre
enough  you look like a lady and it is as much as i
expected of you  you were no beauty as a child 
i smiled at bessies frank answer  i felt that it
was correct but i confess i was not quite indifferent
to its import at eighteen most people wish to
please and the conviction that they have not an
exterior likely to second that desire brings anything
but gratification
i dare say you are clever though continued
bessie by way of solace  what can you do  can
you play on the piano 
a little
there was one in the room  bessie went and
opened it and then asked me to sit down and to
give her a tune  i played a waltz or two and she
was charmed
the miss reeds could not play as well   said
she exultingly  ii always said you would surpass
them in learning and can you draw  
that is one of my paintings over the chimneypiece  it was a landscape in water colours of which
i had made a present to the superintendent in
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the
committee on my behalf and which she had framed
and glazed
well that is beautiful miss jane  it is as fine
a picture as any miss reeds drawingmaster could
paint let alone the young ladies themselves who
could not come near it and have you learnt
french  
150
jane eyre
yes bessie i can both read it and speak it
and you can work on muslin and canvas 
i can
oh you are quite a lady miss jane  i knew
you would be  you will get on whether your relations
notice you or not there was something i wanted
to ask you have you ever heard anything from
your fathers kinsfolk the eyres 
never in my life
well you know missis always said they were
poor and quite despicable  and they may be poor 
but i believe they are as much gentry as the reeds
are  for one day nearly seven years ago a mr eyre
came to gateshead and wanted to see you missis
said you was at school fifty miles off he seemed so
much disappointed for he could not stay  he was
going on a voyage to a foreign country and the ship
was to sail from london in a day or two he looked
quite a gentleman and i believe he was your fathers
brother
what foreign country was he going to bessie  
an island thousands of miles off where they
make winethe butler did tell me 
madeira   i suggested
yes  that is it that is the very word
so he went 
yes  he did not stay many minutes in the
house missis was very high with him  she called
him afterwards a  sneaking tradesman  my robert
believes he was a wine merchant
151
jane eyre
 very likely i returned   or perhaps clerk or
agent to a wine merchant
bessie and i conversed about old times an hour
longer and then she was obliged to leave me  i saw
her again for a few minutes the next morning at
lowton while i was waiting for the coach we
parted finally at the door of the brocklehurst arms
there each went her separate way  she set off for
the brow of lowood fell to meet the conveyance
which was to take her back to gateshead  i mounted
the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and
a new life in the unknown environs of millcote
152
chapter xi
a new chapter in a novel is something like a new
scene in a play  and when i draw up the curtain this
time reader you must fancy you see a room in the
george inn at millcote with such large figured
papering on the walls as inn rooms have  such a
carpet such furniture such ornaments on the mantelpiece such prints including a portrait of george the
third and another of the prince of wales and a
representation of the death of wolfe all this is
visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging
from the ceiling and by that of an excellent fire
near which i sat in my cloak and bonnet  my muff
and umbrella lie on the table and i am warming
away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
hours exposure to the rawness of an october day 
i left lowton at four oclock am and the millcote
town clock is now just striking eight
reader though i look comfortably accommodated
i am not very tranquil in my mind i thought
when the coach stopped here there would be some
one to meet me  i looked anxiously round as i
descended the wooden steps the  boots  placed for
153
jane eyre
my convenience expecting to hear my name pronounced and to see some description of carriage
waiting to convey me to thornfield nothing of the
sort was visible  and when i asked a waiter if any
one had been to inquire after a miss eyre i was
answered in the negative  so i had no resource but
to request to be shown into a private room  and here
i am waiting while all sorts of doubts and fears are
troubling my thoughts
it is a very strange sensation to inexperienced
youth to feel itself quite alone in the world cut
adrift from every connection uncertain whether the
port to which it is bound can be reached and prevented by many impediments from returning to that
it has quitted the charm of adventure sweetens
that sensation the glow of pride warms it  but then
the throb of fear disturbs it  and fear with me
became predominant when half an hour elapsed and
still i was alone i bethought myself to ring the
bell
is there a place in this neighbourhood called
thornfield  i asked of the waiter who answered
the summons
 thornfield  i dont know maam  ill inquire at
the bar he vanished but reappeared instantly
 is your name eyre miss  
yes
person here waiting for you 
i jumped up took my muff and umbrella and
hastened into the inn passage  a man was standing
154
jane eyre
by the open door and in the lamplit street i dimly
saw a onehorse conveyance
 this will be your luggage i suppose   said the
man rather abruptly when he saw me pointing to
my trunk in the passage
yes he hoisted it on to the vehicle which was
a sort of car and then i got in  before he shut me
up i asked him how far it was to thornfield
a matter of six miles
how long shall we be before we get there  
happen an hour and a half 
66
he fastened the car door climbed to his own seat
outside and we set off our progress was leisurely
and gave me ample time to reflect  i was content to
be at length so near the end of my journey  and as
i leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant
conveyance i meditated much at my ease
 i suppose thought i judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage mrs fairfax is not
a very dashing person  so much the better  i never
lived amongst fine people but once and i was very
miserable with them i wonder if she lives alone
except this little girl  if so and if she is in any
degree amiable i shall surely be able to get on with
her  i will do my best  it is a pity that doing ones
best does not always answer at lowood indeed
i took that resolution kept it and succeeded in
pleasing  but with mrs reed i remember my best
was always spurned with scorn i pray god mrs
fairfax may not turn out a second mrs reed  but
155
jane eyre
if she does i am not bound to stay with her  let the
worst come to the worst i can advertise again
how far are we on our road now i wonder 
i let down the window and looked out  millcote
was behind us  judging by the number of its lights
it seemed a place of considerable magnitude much
larger than lowton we were now as far as i could
see on a sort of common  but there were houses
scattered all over the district  i felt we were in a
different region to lowood more populous less
picturesque  more stirring less romantic
the roads were heavy the night misty  my conductor let his horse walk all the way and the hour
and a half extended i verily believe to two hours 
at last he turned in his seat and said
youre noan so far fro thornfield now 
again i looked out  we were passing a church  i
saw its low broad tower against the sky and its bell
was tolling a quarter  i sawa narrowgalaxy oflights
too on a hillside marking a village or hamlet
about ten minutes after the driver got down and
opened a pair of gates  we passed through and they
clashed to behind us we now slowly ascended a
drive and came upon the long front of a house 
candle light gleamed from one curtained bowwindow  all the rest were dark the car stopped at
the front door  it was opened by a maid servant  i
alighted and went in
will you walk this way maam   said the girl 
and i followed her across a square hall with high doors
156

jane eyre
all round she ushered me into a room whose
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled
me contrasting as it did with the darkness to which
my eyes had been for two hours inured  when i
could see however a cosy and agreeable picture
presented itself to my view
a snug small room  a round table by a cheerful
fire  an armchair highbacked and oldfashioned
wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady
in widows cap black silk gown and snowy muslin
apron  exactly like what i had fancied mrs fairfax
only less stately and milder looking she was
occupied in knitting  a large cat sat demurely at her
feet  nothing in short was wanting to complete
the beau ideal of domestic comfort a more reassuring introduction for a new governess could
scarcely be conceived  there was no grandeur to
overwhelm no stateliness to embarrass  and then
as i entered the old lady got up and promptly and
kindly came forward to meet me
how do you do my dear  i am afraid you have
had a tedious ride  john drives so slowly  you must
be cold come to the fire
mrs fairfax i suppose   said i
yes you are right  do sit down 
she conducted me to her own chair and then
began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnetstrings  i begged she would not give herself so much
trouble
oh it is no trouble  i dare say your own hands
157
jane eyre
are almost numbed with cold leah make a little
hot negus and cut a sandwich or two  here are the
keys ofthe store room
and she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys and delivered them to the
servant
now then draw nearer to the fire she continued  youve brought your luggage with you
havent you my dear 
yes maam 
 ill see it carried into your room  she said and
bustled out
she  i treats me like a visitor thought i
little expected such a reception  i anticipated only
coldness and stiffness  this is not like what i have
heard of the treatment of governesses  but i must
not exult too soon
she returned  with her own hands cleared her
knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table
to make room for the tray which leah now brought
and then herself handed me the refreshments i
felt rather confused at being the object of more
attention than i had ever before received and that
too shown by my employer and superior  but as she
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place i thought it better to take
her civilities quietly
shall i have the pleasure of seeing miss fairfax
tonight   i asked when i had partaken of what
she offered me
158
jane eyre
what did you say my dear  i am a little deaf
returned the good lady approaching her ear to my
mouth
i repeated the question more distinctly
miss fairfax  oh you mean miss varens 
varens is the name of your future pupil 
 indeed  then she is not your daughter  
noi have no family
i should have followed up my first inquiry by
asking in what way miss varens was connected with
her  but i recollected it was not polite to ask too
many questions  besides i was sure to hear in time
 i am so glad she continued as she sat down
opposite to me and took the cat on her knee i
am so glad you are come  it will be quite pleasant
living here now with a companion to be sure it is
pleasant at any time  for thornfield is a fine old
hall rather neglected of late years perhaps but still
it is a respectable place  yet you know in winter
time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters
i say aloneleah is a nice girl to be sure and john
and his wife are very decent people  but then you
see they are only servants and one cant converse
with them on terms of equality  one must keep them
at due distance for fear of losing ones authority
im sure last winter it was a very severe one if you
recollect and when it did not snow it rained and
blew not a creature but the butcher and postman
came to the house from november till february 
and i really got quite melancholy with sitting night
159
jane eyre
after night alone  i had leah in to read to mesometimes  but i dont think the poor girl liked the task
much she felt it confining in spring and summer
one got on better  sunshine and long days make
such a difference  and then just at the commencement of this autumn little adela varens came and
her nurse  a child makes a house alive all at once 
and now you are here i shall be quite gay
my heart really warmed to the worthy lady as i
heard her talk  and i drew my chair a little nearer
to her and expressed my sincere wish that she might
find my company as agreeable as she anticipated
 but ill not keep you sitting up late tonight
said she   it is on the stroke of twelve now and you
have been travelling all day  you must feel tired if
you have got your feet well warmed ill show you
your bedroom ive had the room next to mine prepared for you  it is only a small apartment but i
thought you would like it better than one of the
large front chambers  to be sure they have finer
furniture but they are so dreary and solitary i never
sleep in them myself 
i thanked her for her considerate choice and as i
really felt fatigued with my long journey expressed
my readiness to retire she took her candle and i
followed her from the room first she went to see if
the hall door was fastened  having taken the key
from the lock she led the way upstairs the steps
and banisters were of oak  the staircase window was
high and latticed  both it and the long gallery into
160
jane eyre
which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they
belonged to a church rather than a house a very
chill and vaultlike air pervaded the stairs and
gallery suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude  and i was glad when finally ushered into my
chamber to find it of small dimensions and furnished
in ordinary modern style
when mrs fairfax had bidden me a kind goodnight and i had fastened my door gazed leisurely
round and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall that dark and
spacious staircase and that long cold gallery by the
livelier aspect of my little room i remembered that
after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety i was
now at last in safe haven the impulse of gratitude swelled my heart and i knelt down at the bedside and offered up thanks where thanks were due 
not forgetting ere i rose to implore aid on my
further path and the power of meriting the kindness
which seemed so frankly offered to me before it was
earned my couch had no thorns in it that night 
my solitary room no fear at once weary and content i slept soon and soundly  when i awoke it was
broad day
the chamber looked such a bright little place to
me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz
window curtains showing papered walls and a
carpeted floor so unlike the bare planks and stained
plaster of lowood that my spirits rose at the view
externals have a great effect on the young  i
161 m
jane eyre
thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for
me one that was to have its flowers and pleasures as
well as its thorns and toils my faculties roused by
the change of scene the new field offered to hope
seemed all astir i cannot precisely define what
they expected but it was something pleasant  not
perhaps that day or that day month but at an indefinite future period
i rose  i dressed myself with care  obliged to be
plainfor i had no article of attire that was not
made with extreme simplicityi was still by nature
solicitous to be neat it was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression i made  on the contrary i ever wished to look
as well as i could and to please as much as my want
of beauty would permit i sometimes regretted that
i was not handsomer  i sometimes wished to have
rosy cheeks a straight nose and small cherry mouth 
i desired to be tall stately and finely developed in
figure  i felt it a misfortune that i was so little so
pale and had features so irregular and so marked
and why had i these aspirations and these regrets 
it would be difficult to say  i could not then distinctly say it to myself  yet i had a reason and a
logical natural reason too however when i had
brushed my hair very smooth and put on my black
frockwhich quakerlike as it was at least had the
merit of fitting to a nicetyand adjusted my clean
white tucker i thought i should do respectably
enough to appear before mrs fairfax  and that my
162
jane eyrevol i  to face page 162 thornfield hall norton conyers near interior ripon

jane eyre
new pupil would not at least recoil from me with
antipathy having opened my chamber window
and seen that i left all things straight and neat on
the toilet table i ventured forth
traversing the long and matted gallery i descended the slippery steps of oak  then i gained the
hall  i halted there a minute  i looked at some
pictures on the walls one i remember represented a
grim man in a cuirass and one a lady with powdered
hair and a pearl necklace  at a bronze lamp pendent
from the ceiling at a great clock whose case was of
oak curiously carved and ebon black with time and
rubbing everything appeared very stately and imposing to me but then i was so little accustomed to
grandeur the hall door which was half of glass
stood open  i stepped over the threshold it was a
fine autumn morning  the early sun shone serenely
on embrowned groves and still green fields  advancing on to the lawn i looked up and surveyed the
front ofthe mansion it was three storeys high of
proportions not vast though considerable  a gentlemans manorhouse not a noblemans seat  battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look its
grey front stood out well from the background of a
rookery whose cawing tenants were nowon the wing
they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
great meadow from which these were separated by a
sunk fence and where an array of mighty old thorntrees strong knotty and broad as oaks at once explained the etymology of the mansions designation
163
jane eyre
farther off were hills  not so lofty as those round
lowood nor so craggy nor so like barriers of
separation from the living world  but yet quiet and
lonely hills enough and seeming to embrace thornfield with a seclusion i had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of millcote a little
hamlet whose roofs were blent with trees straggled
up the side of one of these hills  the church of the
district stood nearer thornfield  its old towertop
looked over a knoll between the house and gates
i was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant
fresh air yet listening with delight to the cawing of
the rooks yet surveying the wide hoary front of the
hall and thinking what a great place it was for one
lonely little dame like mrs fairfax to inhabit when
that lady appeared at the door
what  out already   said she i see you are
an early riser i went up to her and was received
with an affable kiss and shake of the hand
how do you like thornfield   she asked i
told her i liked it very much
yes she said  it is a pretty place  but i fear
it will be getting out of order unless mr rochester
should take it into his head to come and reside here
permanently  or at least visit it rather oftener
great houses and fine grounds require the presence
of the proprietor 
mr rochester   i exclaimed who is he 
the owner of thornfield she responded quietly
did you not know he was called rochester  
164
jane eyre
of course i did not  i had never heard of him
before  but the old lady seemed to regard his
existence as a universally understood fact with
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct
 i thought i continued thornfield belonged
to you
to me bless you child  what an idea  to
me i am only the housekeeperthe manager
to be sure i am distantly related to the rochesters
by the mothers sideor at least my husband was
he was a clergyman incumbent of haythat little
village yonder on the hilland that church near the
gates was his the present mr rochesters mother
was a fairfax and second cousin to my husband 
but i never presume on the connectionin fact it is
nothing to me i consider myself quite in the light
of an ordinary housekeeper my employer is always
civil and i expect nothing more
and the little girlmy pupil 
she is mr rochesters ward he commissioned
me to find a governess for her he intends to have
her brought up in shire i believe here she
comes with her  bonne as she calls her nurse the
enigma then was explained  this affable and kind
little widow was no great dame but a dependent
like myself i did not like her the worse for
that  on the contrary i felt better pleased than
the equality between her and me was real 
not the mere result of condescension on her part 
so much the bettermy position was all the freer
ever
165
jane eyre
as i was meditating on this discovery a little
girl followed by her attendant came running up the
lawn i looked at my pupil who did not at first
appear to notice me she was quite a childperhaps seven or eight years oldslightly built
with a pale smallfeatured face and a redundancy
of hair falling in curls to her waist
good morning miss adela  said mrs fairfax
come and speak to the lady who is to teach you
and to make you a clever woman some day she
approached
cest là ma gouvernante   said she pointing
to me and addressing her nurse who answered 
mais oui certainement 
are they foreigners   i inquired amazed at
hearing the french language
the nurse is a foreigner and adela was born on
the continent  and i believe never left it till
within six months ago when she first came here
she could speak no english  now she can make shift
to talk it a little i dont understand her she mixes
it so with french  but you will make out her
meaning very well i dare say
fortunately i had had the advantage of being
taught french by a french lady  and as i had
always made a point of conversing with madame
pierrot as often as i could and had besides during
the last seven years learnt a portion of french by
heart dailyapplying myself to take pains with my
accent and imitating as closely as possible the
166
jane eyre
pronunciation of my teacheri had acquired a
certain degree of readiness and correctness in the
language and was not likely to be much at a loss
with mademoiselle adela she came and shook
hands with me when she heard that i was her
governess  and as i led her in to breakfast i
addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue 
she replied briefly at first but after we were seated
at the table and she had examined me some ten
minutes with her large hazel eyes she suddenly
commenced chattering fluently
ah  ” cried she in french  you speak my
language as well as mr rochester does  i can talk
to you as i can to him and so can sophie she
will be glad  nobody here understands her  madame
fairfax is all english sophie is my nurse  she
came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
chimney that smokedhow it did smoke and i
was sick and so was sophie and so was mr
rochester mr rochester lay down on a sofa in a
pretty room called the salon and sophie and i had
little beds in another place i nearly fell out of
mine  it was like a shelf and mademoiselle
what is your name  
eyre jane eyre
aire  bah  i cannot say it well  our ship
stopped in the morning before it was quite daylight at a great citya huge city with very dark
houses and all smoky  not at all like the pretty
clean town i came from  and mr rochester carried
167
jane eyre
me in his arms over a plank to the land and sophie
came after and we all got into a coach which took
us to a beautiful large house larger than this and
finer called an hotel we stayed there nearly a
week i and sophie used to walk every day in a
great green place full of trees called the park  and
there were many children there besides me and
a pond with beautiful birds in it that i fed with
crumbs 

can you understand her when she runs on so
fast  asked mrs fairfax
i understood her very well for i had been
accustomed to the fluent tongue of madame pierrot
i wish continued the good lady  you would
ask her a question or two about her parents i
wonder if she remembers them  
adèle i inquired  with whom did you live when
you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of  
i lived long ago with mamma  but she is gone
to the holy virgin mamma used to teach me to
dance and sing and to say verses a great many
gentlemen and ladies came to see mamma and
i used to dance before them or to sit on their
knees and sing to them  i liked it shall i let you
hear me sing now 
she had finished her breakfast so i permitted
her to give a specimen of her accomplishments
descending from her chair she came and placed
herself on my knee  then folding her little hands
demurely before her shaking back her curls and
168
jane eyre
lifting her eyes to the ceiling she commenced
singing a song from some opera it was the strain
of a forsaken lady who after bewailing the perfidy
of her lover calls pride to her aid  desires her
attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and
richest robes and resolves to meet the false one
that night at a ball and prove to him by the gaiety
of her demeanour how little his desertion has
affected her
the subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant
singer  but i suppose the point of the exhibition lay
in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled
with the lisp of childhood  and in very bad taste
that point was at least i thought so
adèle sang the canzonette tunefully enough and
with the naïveté of her age this achieved she
jumped from my knee and said  now mademoiselle
i will repeat you some poetry 
assuming an attitude she began  la ligue des
rats  fable de la fontaine she then declaimed
the little piece with an attention to punctuation
and emphasis a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture very unusual indeed at her
age and which proved she had been carefully
trained
was it your mamma who taught you that piece 
i asked
yes  and she just used to say it in this way 
quavez vous donc
parlez   she made
lui dit un de ces rats 
me lift my handsoto
169
jane eyre
remind me to raise my voice at the question now
shall i dance for you  
no  that will do but after your mamma went
to the holy virgin as you say with whom did you
live then 
with madame frédéric and her husband  she
took care of me but she is nothing related to me
i think she is poor for she had not so fine a house
as mamma i was not long there mr rochester
asked me if i would like to go and live with him in
england and i said yes  for i knew mr rochester
before i knew madame frédéric and he was always
kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys 
but you see he has not kept his word for he has
brought me to england and now he has gone back
again himself and i never see him
after breakfast adèle and i withdrew to the
library  which room it appears mr rochester had
directed should be used as the schoolroom most
of the books were locked up behind glass doors  but
there was one book case left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary
works and several volumes of light literature poetry
biography travels a few romances etc i suppose
he had considered that these were all the governess
would require for her private perusal  and indeed
they contented me amply for the present  compared with the scanty pickings i had now and then
been able to glean at lowood they seemed to offer
an abundant harvest of entertainment and informa170

tion in this room too there was a cabinet piano
quite new and of superior tone  also an easel for
painting and a pair of globes
i found my pupil sufficiently docile though disinclined to apply  she had not been used to regular
occupation of any kind i felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first  so when i
had talked to her a great deal and got her to learn
a little and when the morning had advanced to
noon i allowed her to return to her nurse i then
proposed to occupy myself till dinnertime in
drawing some little sketches for her use
as i was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and
pencils mrs fairfax called to me   your morning
school hours are over now i suppose said she
she was in a room the folding doors of which stood
open i went in when she addressed me it was a
large stately apartment with purple chairs and curtains a turkey carpet walnut panelled walls one
vast window rich in stained glass and a lofty ceiling
nobly moulded mrs fairfax was dusting some vases
of fine purple spar which stood on a side board
what a beautiful room   i exclaimed as i
looked round  for i had never before seen any half
so imposing
yes  this is the diningroom i have just
opened the window to let in a little air and sunshine 
for everything gets so damp in apartments that are
seldom inhabited  the drawingroom yonder feels
like a vault 
171
jane eyre
she pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the
window and hung like it with a tyrian dyed curtain
now looped up mounting to it by two broad steps
and looking through i thought i caught a glimpse
of a fairy place so bright to my novice eyes
appeared the view beyond yet it was merely a
very pretty drawing room and within it a boudoir
both spread with white carpets on which seemed
laid brilliant garlands of flowers  both ceiled with
snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine leaves
beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson
couches and ottomans  while the ornaments on the
pale parian mantelpiece were of sparkling bohemian
glass ruby red  and between the windows large
mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire
 in what order you keep these rooms mrs
fairfax   said i  no dust no canvas coverings 
except that the air feels chilly one would think they
were inhabited daily
why miss eyre though mr rochesters visits
here are rare they are always sudden and unexpected  and as i observed that it put him out to find
everything swathed up and to have a bustle of
arrangement on his arrival i thought it best to keep
the rooms in readiness 
is mr rochester an exacting fastidious sort of
man 
not particularly so  but he has a gentlemans
tastes and habits and he expects to have things
managed in conformity to them 
172
jane eyre
do you like him  is he generally liked  
 oh yes  the family have always been respected
here almost all the land in this neighbourhood as
far as you can see has belonged to the rochesters
time out of mind 
well but leaving his land out of the question
do you like him is he liked for himself 
ihave no cause to do otherwise than like him 
and i believe he is considered a just and liberal
landlord by his tenants  but he has never lived much
amongst them ”
 but has he no peculiarities  what in short is
his character  
 oh his character is unimpeachable i suppose
he is rather peculiar perhaps he has travelled a
great deal and seen a great deal of the world i
should think i dare say he is clever  but i never
had much conversation with him 
 in what way is he peculiar 

 i dont knowit is not easy to describenothing
striking but you feel it when he speaks to you  you
cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or
earnest whether he is pleased or the contrary  you
dont thoroughly understand him in shortat least
i dont but it is of no consequence he is a very
good master
this was all the account i got from mrs fairfax
of her employer and mine there are people who
seem to have no notion of sketching a character or
observing and describing salient points either in
173
jane eyre
persons or things  the good lady evidently belonged
to this class  my queries puzzled but did not draw
her out mr rochester was mr rochester in her
eyes  a gentleman a landed proprietornothing
more she inquired and searched no further and
evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
definite notion of his identity
when we left the diningroom she proposed to
show me over the rest of the house  and i followed
her upstairs and downstairs admiring as i went  for
all was well arranged and handsome the large
front chambers i thought especially grand  and some
of the thirdstorey rooms though dark and low were
interesting from their air of antiquity the furniture
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from
time to time been removed here as fashions
changed  and the imperfect light entering by their
narrow casements showed bedsteads of a hundred
years old  chests in oak or walnut looking with their
strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs
heads like types of the hebrew ark  rows of
venerable chairs highbacked and narrow  stools
still more antiquated on whose cushioned tops were
yet apparent traces of half effaced embroideries
wrought by fingers that for two generations had been
coffin dust all these relics gave to the third storey
of thornfield hall the aspect of a home of the past
a shrine of memory i liked the hush the gloom
the quaintness of these retreats in the day  but i by
no means coveted a nights repose on one of those
174
jane eyre
wide and heavy beds  shut in some of them with
doors of oak  shaded others with wrought old
english hangings crusted with thick work portraying effigies of strange flowers and stranger birds
and strangest human beings all which would have
looked strange indeed by the pallid gleam of moonlight
do the servants sleep in these rooms   i asked
no  they occupy a range of smaller apartments
to the back  no one ever sleeps here one would
almost say that if there were a ghost at thornfield
hall this would be its haunt
so i think you have no ghost then  
none that i ever heard of returned mrs fairfax smiling
nor any traditions of one  no legends or ghost
stories 
i believe not and yet it is said the rochesters
have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their
time  perhaps though that is the reason they rest
tranquilly in their graves now 
yes after lifes fitful fever they sleep well i
muttered where are you going now mrs fairfax   for she was moving away
on to the leads  will you come and see the view
from thence  i followed still  up a very narrow
staircase to the attics and thence by a ladder and
through a trap door to the roof of the hall i was
now on a level with the crow colony and could see
into their nests leaning over the battlements and
175
jane eyre
looking far down i surveyed the grounds laid out
like a map the bright and velvet lawn closely
girdling the grey base of the mansion  the field
wide as a park dotted with its ancient timber  the
wood dun and sere divided by a path visibly overgrown greener with moss than the trees were with
foliage  the church at the gates the road the
tranquil hills all reposing in the autumn days sun 
the horizon bounded by a propitious sky azure
marbled with pearly white no feature in the scene
was extraordinary but all was pleasing when i
turned from it and repassed the trapdoor i could
scarcely see my way down the ladder  the attic
seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of
blue air to which i had been looking up and to
that sunlit scene of grove pasture and green hill of
which the hall was the centre and over which i had
been gazing with delight
mrs fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten
the trapdoor  i by dint ofgroping found the outlet
from the attic and proceeded to descend the narrow
garret staircase i lingered in the long passage to
which this led separating the front and back rooms
of the third storeynarrow low and dim with only
one little window at the far end and looking with
its two rows of small black doors all shut like a
corridor in some bluebeards castle
while i paced softly on the last sound i expected
to hear in so still a region a laugh struck my ear
it was a curious laughdistinct formal mirthless i
176
jane eyre
stopped  the sound ceased only for an instant 
it began again louderfor at first though distinct
it was very low it passed off in a clamorous peal
that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely
chamber though it originated but in one and i
could have pointed out the door whence the accents
issued
 mrs fairfax   i called outfor i now heard
her descending the great stairs  did you hear
that loud laugh  who is it 
some ofthe servants very likely she answered 
perhaps grace poole 
did you hear it   i again inquired
yes plainly  i often hear her she sews in one
ofthese rooms sometimes leah is with her  they
are frequently noisy together 
the laugh was repeated in its low syllabic tone
and terminated in an odd murmur
 grace   exclaimed mrs fairfax
any
i really did not expect any grace to answer  for
the laugh was as tragic as preternatural a laugh as
i ever heard  and but that it was high noon
and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied
the curious cachirnation  but that neither scene nor
season favoured fear i should have been superstitiously afraid however the event showed me i
was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise
the door nearest me opened and a servant came
out a woman of between thirty and forty  a set
squaremade figure redhaired and with a hard
177 n
jane eyre
plain face any apparition less romantic or less
ghostly could scarcely be conceived
 too much noise grace said mrs fairfax
remember directions   grace curtsied silently
and went in
she is a person we have to sew and assist leah
in her housemaids work continued the widow 
not altogether unobjectionable in some points but
she does well enough bythebye how have you
got on with your new pupil this morning  
the conversation thus turned on adèle continued
till we reached the light and cheerful region below
adèle came running to meet us in the hall exclaiming
mesdames vous êtes servies   adding  jai
bien faim moi  
we found dinner ready and waiting for us in
mrs fairfaxs room
178
chapter xil
the promise of a smooth career which my first
calm introduction to thornfield hall seemed to
pledge was not belied on a longer acquaintance
with the place and its inmates mrs fairfax turned
out to be what she appeared a placidtempered
kindnatured woman of competent education and
average intelligence my pupil was a lively child
who had been spoilt and indulged and therefore
was sometimes wayward  but as she was committed
entirely to my care and no injudicious interference
from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her
improvement she soon forgot her little freaks and
became obedient and teachable she had no great
talents no marked traits of character no peculiar
development of feeling or taste which raised her one
inch above the ordinary level of childhood  but
neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk
her below it she made reasonable progress entertained for me a vivacious though perhaps not very
profound affection  and by her simplicity gay
prattle and efforts to please inspired me in return
179
jane eyre
with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us
both content in each others society
this parparénthèse will be thought cool language
by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about
the angelic nature of children and the duty of those
charged with their education to conceive for them
an idolatrous devotion  but i am not writing to
flatter parental egotism to echo cant or prop up
humbug  i am merely telling the truth i felt a
conscientious solicitude for adèles welfare and
progress and a quiet liking to her little self just as
i cherished towards mrs fairfax a thankfulness for
her kindness and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me and
the moderation of her mind and character
anybody may blame me who likes when i add
further that now and then when i took a walk by
myself in the grounds  when i went down to the
gates and looked through them along the road  or
when while adèle played with her nurse and mrs
fairfax made jellies in the storeroom i climbed the
three staircases raised the trapdoor of the attic
and having reached the leads looked out afar over
sequestered field and hill and along dim skylinethat then i longed for a power of vision which might
overpass that limit  which might reach the busy
world towns regions full of life i had heard of but
never seen  that then i desired more of practical
experience than i possessed  more of intercourse
with my kind of acquaintance with variety of
180
jane eyre
character than was here within my reach i valued
what was good in mrs fairfax and what was good
in adèle  but i believed in the existence of other
and more vivid kinds of goodness and what i
believed in i wished to behold
who blames me  many no doubt  and i shall
be called discontented i could not help it  the
restlessness was in my nature  it agitated me to
pain sometimes then my sole relief was to walk
along the corridor of the third storey backwards and
forwards safe in the silence and solitude of the spot
and allow my minds eye to dwell on whatever bright
visions rose before itand certainly they were
many and glowing  to let my heart be heaved by the
exultant movement which while it swelled it in
trouble expanded it with life  and best of all to
open myinward ear to a tale that was never endeda tale my imagination created and narrated continuously  quickened with all of incident life fire
feeling that i desired and had not in my actual
existence
it is in vain to say human beings ought to be
satisfied with tranquillity  they must have action 
and they will make it if they cannot find it millions
are condemned to a stiller doom than mine and
millions are in silent revolt against their lot
nobody knows how many rebellions besides political
rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people
the earth women are supposed to be very calm
generally but women feel just as men feel  they
181
jane eyre
need exercise for their faculties and a field for their
efforts as much as their brothers do  they suffer
from too rigid a restraint too absolute a stagnation
precisely as men would suffer  and it is narrowminded in their more privileged fellowcreatures to
say that they ought to confine themselves to making
puddings and knitting stockings to playing on the
piano and embroidering bags it is thoughtless to
condemn them or laugh at them if they seek to do
more or learn more than custom has pronounced
necessary for their sex
when thus alone i not unfrequently heard grace
pooles laugh  the same peal the same low slow
ha ha  which when first heard had thrilled me  i
heard too her eccentric murmurs  stranger than
her laugh there were days when she was quite
silent  but there were others when i could not
account for the sounds she made sometimes i saw
her she would come out of her room with a basin
or a plate or a tray in her hand go down to the
kitchen and shortly return generally oh romantic
reader forgive me for telling the plain truth bearing
a pot of porter her appearance always acted as a
damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities 
hardfeatured and staid she had no point to which
interest could attach i made some attempts to
draw her into conversation but she seemed a person
of few words  a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
every effort of that sort
the other members of the household viz  john
182
jane eyre
and his wife leah the housemaid and sophie the
french nurse were decent people  but in no respect
remarkable  with sophie i used to talk french and
sometimes i asked her questions about her native
country  but she was not ofa descriptive or narrative
turn and generally gave such vapid and confused
answers as were calculated rather to check than
encourage inquiry
october november december passed away one
afternoon in january mrs fairfax had begged a
holiday for adèle because she had a cold  and as
adèle seconded the request with an ardour that
reminded me how precious occasional holidays had
been to me in my own childhood i accorded it
deeming that i did well in showing pliability on the
point it was a fine calm day though very cold  i
was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole
long morning  mrs fairfax had just written a letter
which was waiting to be posted so i put on my
bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to hay 
the distance two miles would be a pleasant winter
afternoon walk having seen adèle comfortably
seated in her little chair by mrs fairfaxs parlour
fireside and given her her best wax doll which i
usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer
to play with and a storybook for change of amusement  and having replied to her  revenez bientôt
ma bonne amie ma chère mdlle jeannette  with a
kiss i set out
the ground was hard the air was still my road
183
jane eyre
was lonely  i walked fast till i got warm and then i
walked slowly to enjoy and analyze the species of
pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation
it was three oclock  the church bell tolled as i
passed under the belfry  the charm of the hour lay
in its approaching dimness in the lowgliding and
palebeaming sun i was a mile from thornfield in
a lane noted for wild roses in summer for nuts and
blackberries in autumn and even now possessing a
few coral treasures in hips and haws but whose best
winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless
repose if a breath of air stirred it made no sound
here  for there was not a holly not an evergreen to
rustle and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes
were as still as the white worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path far and wide on
each side there were only fields where no cattle now
browsed  and the little brown birds which stirred
occasionally in the hedge looked like single russet
leaves that had forgotten to drop
this lane inclined uphill all the way to hay  having
reached the middle i sat down on the stile which led
thence into a field gathering my mantle about me
and sheltering my hands in my muff i did not feel
the cold though it froze keenly  as was attested by
a sheet of ice covering the causeway where a little
brooklet now congealed had overflowed after a rapid
thaw some days since from my seat i could
look down on thornfield  the grey and battlemented
hall was the principal object in the vale below me 
184
jane eyre
its woods and dark rookery rose against the west i
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees
and sank crimson and clear behind them i then
turned eastward
on the hilltop above me sat the rising moon 
pale yet as a cloud but brightening momently  she
looked over hay which half lost in trees sent up a
blue smoke from its few chimneys  it was yet a mile
distant but in the absolute hush i could hear
plainly its thin murmurs of life my ear too felt the
flow of currents  in what dales and depths i could
not tell but there were many hills beyond hay and
doubtless many becks threading their passes that
evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the
nearest streams the sough ofthe most remote
a rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and
whisperings at once so far away and so clear  a
positive tramp tramp  a metallic clatter which
effaced the soft wavewanderings as in a picture
the solid mass of a crag or the rough boles of a
great oak drawn in dark and strong on the foreground efface the aerial distance of azure hill 
sunny horizon and blended clouds where tint melts
into tint
the din was on the causeway  a horse was
coming  the windings of the lane yet hid it but it
approached i was just leaving the stile  yet as the
path was narrow i sat still to let it go by in those
days i was young and all sorts of fancies bright and
dark tenanted my mind  the memories of nursery
185
jane eyre
stories were there amongst other rubbish  and when
they recurred maturing youth added to them a
vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could
give as this horse approached and as i watched
for it to appear through the dusk i remembered
certain of bessies tales wherein figured a north ofengland spirit called a  gytrash   which in the
form of horse mule or large dog haunted solitary
ways and sometimes came upon belated travellers
as this horse was now coming upon me
it was very near but not yet in sight  when in
addition to the tramp tramp i heard a rush under
the hedge and close down by the hazel stems glided
a great dog whose black and white colour made him
a distinct object against the trees it was exactly
one mask of bessies gytrash a lionlike creature
with long hair and a huge head  it passed me
however quietly enough  not staying to look up
with strange pretercanine eyes in my face as i half
expected it would the horse followed a tall
steed and on its back a rider the man the
human being broke the spell at once nothing
ever rode the gytrash  it was always alone  the
goblins to my notions though they might tenant
the dumb carcases of beasts could scarce covet
shelter in the commonplace human form no gytrash
was this only a traveller taking the short cut to
millcote he passed and i went on  a few steps
and i turned  a sliding sound and an exclamation
ofwhat the deuce is to do now  and a clattering
186
jane eyre
tumble arrested my attention man and horse were
down  they had slipped on the sheet of ice which
glazed the causeway the dog came bounding
back and seeing his master in a predicament and
hearing the horse groan barked till the evening
hills echoed the sound which was deep in proportion to his magnitude he snuffed round the
prostrate group and then he ran up to me  it was
all he could do there was no other help at hand
to summon i obeyed him and walked down to the
traveller by this time struggling himself free of his
steed his efforts were so vigorous i thought
he could not be much hurt  but i asked him the
question
are you injured sir  
i think he was swearing but am not certain 
however he was pronouncing some formula which
prevented him from replying to me directly
can i do anything   i asked again
you must just stand on one side he answered
as he rose first to his knees then to his feet i did 
whereupon began a heaving stamping clattering
process accompanied by a barking and baying
which removed me effectually some yards distance 
but i would not be driven quite away till i saw the
event this was finally fortunate  the horse was reestablished and the dog was silenced with a down
pilot   the traveller now stooping felt his foot
and leg as if trying whether they were sound 
apparently something ailed them for he halted
187
jane eyre
to the stile whence i had just risen and sat
down
i was in the mood for being useful or at least
officious i think for i now drew near him again
ifyou are hurt and want help sir i can fetch
some one either from thornfield hall or from hay
thank you  i shall do  i have no broken bones
only a sprain   and again he stood up and tried
his foot but the result extorted an involuntary
 ugh  
something of daylight still lingered and the moon
was waxing bright  i could see him plainly his
figure was enveloped in a ridingcloak furcollared
and steel clasped  its details were not apparent
but i traced the general points of middle height
and considerable breadth of chest he had a dark
face with stern features and a heavy brow  his eyes
and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted
just now  he was past youth but had not reached
middle age  perhaps he might be thirtyfive i
felt no fear of him and but little shyness had he
been a handsome heroiclooking young gentleman
i should not have dared to stand thus questioning
him against his will and offering my services
unasked ii had hardly ever seen a handsome
youth  never in my life spoken to one
i had a
theoretical reverence and homage for beauty
elegance gallantry fascination  but had i met
those qualities incarnate in masculine shape i
should have known instinctively that they neither
188
jane eyre
had nor could have sympathy with anything in me
and should have shunned them as one would fire
lightning or anything else that is bright but
antipathetic
if even this stranger had smiled and been goodhumoured to me when i addressed him  if he had
put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks
i should have gone on my way and not felt any
vocation to renew inquiries  but the frown the
roughness of the traveller set me at my ease  i
retained my station when he waved me to go and
announced 
i cannot think of leaving you sir at so late an
hour in this solitary lane till i see you are fit to
mount your horse 
he looked at me when i said this  he had hardly
turned his eyes in my direction before
i should think you ought to be at home yourself 
said he if you have a home in this neighbourhood
where do you come from  
from just below  and i am not at all afraid of
being out late when it is moonlight  i will run
over to hay for you with pleasure if you wish it 
indeed i am going there to post a letter 
you live just belowdo you mean at that house
with the battlements   pointing to thornfield hall
on which the moon cast a hoary gleam bringing it
out distinct and pale from the woods that by contrast with the western sky now seemed one mass of
shadow
189
jane eyre
yes sir
whose house is it  
mr rochesters

 do you know mr rochester  
no i have never seen him
he is not resident then  
 no
can you tell me where he is  
 i cannot
you are not a servant at the hall of course
you are  he stopped ran his eye over my dress
which as usual was quite simple  a black merino
cloak a black beaver bonnet  neither of them half
fine enough for a ladysmaid he seemed puzzled
to decide what i was  i helped him
i am the governess 
ah the governess   he repeated   deuce take
me if i had not forgotten  the governess   and
again my raiment underwent scrutiny in two
minutes he rose from the stile  his face expressed
pain when he tried to move
i cannot commission you to fetch help he said 
 but you may help me a little yourself if you will
be so kind
yes sir
you have not an umbrella that i can use as a
stick 
no
try to get hold of my horses bridle and lead him
to me you are not afraid  
190
jane eyre
i should have been afraid to touch a horse when
alone but when told to do it i was disposed to
obey i put down my muff on the stile and went
up to the tall steed  i endeavoured to catch the
bridle but it was a spirited thing and would not
let me come near its head  i made effort an effort
though in vain meantime i was mortally afraid
of its trampling forefeet the traveller waited
and watched for some time and at last he
laughed
 i see he said  the mountain will never be
brought to mahomet so all you can do is to aid
mahomet to go to the mountain  i must beg of you
come here 
i came excuse me he continued   necessity
compels me to make you useful he laid a heavy
hand on my shoulder and leaning on me with some
stress limped to his horse having once caught the
bridle he mastered it directly and sprang to his
saddle  grimacing grimly as he made the effort for
it wrenched his sprain
now said he releasing his under lip from a hard
bite just hand me my whip  it lies there under
the hedge 
i sought it and found it
 thank you  now make haste with the letter to
hay and return as fast as you can

a touch of a spurred heel made his horse first
start and rear and then bound away  the dog rushed
in his traces  all three vanished191
jane eyre
like heath that in the wilderness
the wild wind whirls away
i took up my muff and walked on the incident
had occurred and was gone for me it was an incident of no moment no romance no interest in a
sense  yet it marked with a change one single hour
of a monotonous life my help had been needed
and claimed  i had given it  i was pleased to have
done something  trivial transitory though the deed
was it was yet an active thing and i was weary of
an existence all passive the new face too was
like a new picture introduced to the gallery of
memory  and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there  firstly because it was masculine  and
secondly because it was dark strong and stern i
had it still before me when i entered hay and
slipped the letter into the post office  i saw it as i
walked fast down hill all the way home when i
came to the stile i stopped a minute looked round
and listened with an idea that a horses hoofs might
ring on the causeway again and that a rider in
a cloak and a gytrashlike newfoundland dog
might be again apparent  i saw only the hedge and
a pollard willow before me rising up still and
straight to meet the moonbeams  i heard only the
faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees
round thornfield a mile distant  and when i
glanced down in the direction of the murmur my
eye traversing the hall front caught a light kindling
192
jane eyre
in a window  it reminded me that i was late and
i hurried on
i did not like reentering thornfield  to pass its
threshold was to return to stagnation  to cross the
silent hall to ascend the darksome staircase to seek
my own lonely little room and then to meet tranquil
mrs fairfax and spend the long winter evening with
her and her only was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk to slip again over
my faculties the viewless fetters of a uniform and too
still existence  of an existence whose very privileges
of security and ease i was becoming incapable of
appreciating what good it would have done me at
that time to have been tossed in the storms of an
uncertain struggling life and to have been taught
by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm
amidst which i now repined  yes  just as much
good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a
too easy chair  to take a long walk and just as
natural was the wish to stir under my circumstances
as it would be under his
i lingered at the gates  i lingered on the lawn  i
paced backwards and forwards on the pavement  the
shutters of the glass door were closed  i could not
see into the interior  and both my eyes and spirit
seemed drawn from the gloomy housefrom the
grey hollow filled with rayless cells as it appeared to
me to that sky expanded before me —a blue sea
absolved from taint of cloud  the moon ascending it
in solemn march  her orb seeming to look up as she
193 0
jane eyre
left the hill tops from behind which she had come
far and farther below her and aspired to the zenith
midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance and for those trembling stars that
followed her course  they made my heart tremble
my veins glow when i viewed them little things
recall us to earth  the clock struck in the hall  that
sufficed  i turned from moon and stars opened a
side door and went in
the hall was not dark nor yet was it lit only by
the highhung bronze lamp a warm glow suffused
both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase
this ruddy shine issued from the great diningroom
whose two leaved door stood open and showed a
genial fire in the grate glancing on marble hearth
and brass fireirons and revealing purple draperies
and polished furniture in the most pleasant radiance
it revealed too a group near the mantelpiece  i
had scarcely caught it and scarcely become aware of
a cheerful mingling of voices amongst which i
seemed to distinguish the tones of adèle when the
door closed
i hastened to mrs fairfaxs room there was a
fire there too but no candle and no mrs fairfax
instead all alone sitting upright on the rug and
gazing with gravity at the blaze i beheld a great
black and white longhaired dog just like the
gytrash of the lane it was so like it that i went
forward and said 
 pilot and the thing got up and came to me and
194
jane eyre

snuffed me i caressed him and he wagged his
great tail but he looked an eerie creature to be
alone with and i could not tell whence he had come
i rang the bell for i wanted a candle  and i wanted
too to get an account of this visitant
entered
what dog is this  
he came with master
with whom 
with master mr rochester
arrived 
leah
he is just 
 indeed  and is mrs fairfax with him 
yes and miss adela  they are in the diningroom and john is gone for a surgeon for master has
had an accident  his horse fell and his ankle is
sprained 
did the horse fall in hay lane 
yes coming down hill  it slipped on some ice 
 ah  bring me a candle will you leah 
leah brought it  she entered followed by mrs
fairfax who repeated the news adding that mr
carter the surgeon was come and was now with
mr rochester  then she hurried out to give orders
about tea and i went upstairs to take off my things
195
chapter xiii
mr rochester it seems by the surgeons orders
went to bed early that night  nor did he rise soon
next morning when he did come down it was to
attend to business  his agent and some of his
tenants were arrived and waiting to speak with him
adèle and i had now to vacate the library  it
would be in daily requisition as a receptionroom for
callers a fire was lit in an apartment upstairs and
there i carried our books and arranged it for the
future schoolroom i discerned in the course of the
morning that thornfield hall was a changed place
no longer silent as a church it echoed every hour or
two to a knock at the door or a clang of the bell 
steps too often traversed the hall and new voices
spoke in different keys below a rill from the outer
world was flowing through it  it had a master  for
my part i liked it better
adèle was not easy to teach that day  she could
not apply  she kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could get a
glimpse of mr rochester  then she coined pretexts
to go downstairs in order as i shrewdly suspected
to visit the library where i knew she was not wanted 
196
jane eyre
then when i got a little angry and made her still
she continued to talk incessantly of her  ami
monsieur edouard fairfax de rochester as she
dubbed him i had not before heard his prenomens
and to conjecture what presents he had brought her 
for it appears he had intimated the night before that
when his luggage came from millcote there would
be found amongst it a little box in whose contents
she had an interest
et cela doit signifier said she  quil y aura là
dedans un cadeau pour moi et peutêtre pour vous
aussi mademoiselle monsieur a parlé de vous  il
ma demandé le nom de ma gouvernante et si elle
nétait pas une petite personne assez mince et un
peu pâle jai dit quoui  car cest vrai nest ce
pas mademoiselle  
i and my pupil dined as usual in mrs fairfaxs
parlour  the afternoon was wild and snowy and
we passed it in the schoolroom at dark i
allowed adèle to put away books and work and
to run downstairs  for from the comparative
silence below and from the cessation of appeals to
the door bell i conjectured that mr rochester was
now at liberty left alone i walked to the window 
but nothing was to be seen thence twilight and
snowflakes together thickened the air and hid the
very shrubs on the lawn i let down the curtain and
went back to the fireside
in the clear embers i was tracing a view not
unlike a picture i remembered to have seen of the
197
jane eyre
castle of heidelberg on the rhine when mrs
fairfax came in breaking up by her entrance the
fiery mosaic i had been piecing together and
scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that
were beginning to throng on my solitude
mr rochester would be glad if you and your
pupil would take tea with him in the drawing room
this evening said she he has been so much
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you
before
when is his tea time   i inquired
66 oh at six oclock he keeps early hours in the
country you had better change your frock now 
i will go with you and fasten it here is a
candle 
 is it necessary to change my frock  
yes you had better i always dress for the
evening when mr rochester is here
this additional ceremony seemed somewhat
stately however i repaired to my room and with
mrs fairfaxs aid replaced my black stuff dress by
one of black silk  the best and the only additional
one i had except one of light grey which in my
lowood notions of the toilette i thought too fine to
be worn except on first rate occasions
 you want a brooch said mrs fairfax i had a
single little pearl ornament which miss temple gave
me as a parting keepsake i put it on and then
we went downstairs unused as i was to strangers
it was rather a trial to appear thus formally
198
jane eyre
summoned in mr rochesters presence i let mrs
fairfax precede me into the diningroom and kept
in her shade as we crossed that apartment  and
passing the arch whose curtain was now dropped
entered the elegant recess beyond
two wax candles stood lighted on the table and
two on the mantelpiece  basking in the light and
heat of a superb fire lay pilotadèle knelt near
him half reclined on a couch appeared mr
rochester his foot supported by the cushion  he
was looking at adèle and the dog  the fire shone
full on his face i knew my traveller with his broad
and jetty eyebrows his square forehead made
squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair
i recognized his decisive nose more remarkable for
character than beauty  his full nostrils denoting i
thought choler  his grim mouth chin and jaw
yes all three were very grim and no mistake
his shape now divested of cloak i perceived
harmonized in squareness with his physiognomy 
suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense
of the termbroad chested and thinflanked though
neither tall nor graceful
i
mr rochester must have been aware of the
entrance of mrs fairfax and myself but it
appeared he was not in the mood to notice us for
he never lifted his head as we approached
here is miss eyre sir said mrs fairfax in her
quiet way he bowed still not taking his eyes
from the group of the dog and child
199
jane eyre
let miss eyre be seated  said he  and there
was something in the forced stiff bow in the
impatient yet formal tone which seemed further to
express what the deuce is it to me whether miss
eyre be there or not  at this moment i am not
disposed to accost her 
i sat down quite disembarrassed a reception of
finished politeness would probably have confused
me  i could not have returned or repaid it by
answering grace and elegance on my part  but
harsh caprice laid me under no obligation  on the
contrary a decent quiescence under the freak of
manner gave me the advantage besides the
eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant  i felt
interested to see how he would go on
he went on as a statue would that is he neither
spoke nor moved mrs fairfax seemed to think it
necessary that someone should be amiable and she
began to talk kindly as usualand as usual
rather triteshe condoled with him on the pressure
of business he had had all day  on the annoyance it
must have been to him with that painful sprain 
then she commended his patience and perseverance
in going through with it

madame i should like some tea was the sole
rejoinder she got she hastened to ring the bell
and when the tray came she proceeded to arrange
the cups spoons etc  with assiduous celerity i
and adèle went to the table  but the master did not
leave his couch
200
jane eyre
will you hand mr rochesters cup   said mrs
fairfax to me  adèle might perhaps spill it
i did as requested as he took the cup from my
hand adèle thinking the moment propitious for
making a request in my favour cried out 
nest ce pas monsieur quil y a un cadeau
pour mademoiselle eyre dans votre petit coffre  
who talks of cadeaux   said he gruffly   did
you expect a present miss eyre  are you fond of
presents   and he searched my face with eyes that
i saw were dark irate and piercing
66
i hardly know sir  i have little experience of
them they are generally thought pleasant things 
generally thought  but what do you think 
i should be obliged to take time sir before i
could give you an answer worthy ofyour acceptance 
a present has many faces to it has it not  and one
should consider all before pronouncing an opinion
as to its nature 
miss eyre you are not so unsophisticated as
adèle  she demands a  cadeau clamorously the
moment she sees me  you beat about the bush 
because i have less confidence in my deserts
than adèle has she can prefer the claim of old
acquaintance and the right too of custom  for she
says you have always been in the habit of giving her
playthings  but if i had to make out a case i should
be puzzled since i am a stranger and have done
nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment
 oh dont fall back on over modesty  i have
201
jane eyre iexamined adèle and find you have taken great
pains with her she is not bright she has no
talents  yet in a short time she has made much
improvement
66 sir you have now given me my  cadeau   i am
obliged to you  it is the meed teachers most covet 
praise of their pupils progress
humph   said mr rochester and he took his
tea in silence
come to the fire  said the master when the
tray was taken away and mrs fairfax had settled
into a corner with her knitting  while adèle was
leading me by the hand round the room showing
me the beautiful books and ornaments on the
consoles and chiffonnières we obeyed as in duty
bound  adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee
but she was ordered to amuse herself with pilot
you have been resident in my house three
months 
yes sir 
and you came from  
 from lowood school in shire
ah a charitable concern how long were you
there 
66 eight years 
eight years  you must be tenacious of life i
thought half the time in such a place would have
done up any constitution  no wonder you have
rather the look of another world i marvelled
where you had got that sort of face when you
202
jane eyre
came on me in hay lane last night i thought
unaccountably of fairy tales and had half a mind to
demand whether you had bewitched my horse  i
am not sure yet who are your parents  
 i have none
 nor ever had i suppose  do you remember
them  
 no
i thought not and so you were waiting for
your people when you sat on that stile  
 for whom sir 
for the men in green  it was a proper moonlight evening for them did i break through one of
your rings that you spread that damned ice on the
causeway  
i shook my head the men in green all forsook
england a hundred years ago said i speaking as
seriously as he had done and not even in hay
lane or the fields about it could you find a trace of
them i dont think either summer or harvest or
winter moon will ever shine on their revels more 
mrs fairfax had dropped her knitting and with
raised eyebrows seemed wondering what sort of talk
this was

well resumed mr rochester  if you disown
parents you must have some sort of kinsfolk  uncles
and aunts  
no none that i ever saw 
and your home
i have none
203
jane eyre
where do your brothers and sisters live  
i have no brothers or sisters 
who recommended you to come here 
i advertised and mrs fairfax answered my
advertisement 
yes said the good lady who now knew what
ground we were upon  and i am daily thankful
for the choice providence led me to make miss
eyre has been an invaluable companion to me and
a kind and careful teacher to adèle
dont trouble yourself to give her a character
returned mr rochester   eulogiums will not bias
me  i shall judge for myself she began by felling
myhorse 
sir  said mrs fairfax
 i have to thank her for this sprain
the widow looked bewildered
miss eyre have you ever lived in a town  
no sir 
have you seen much society  
none but the pupils and teachers of lowood 
and now the inmates of thornfield 
 have you read much  
 only such books as came in my way  and they
have not been numerous or very learned 
you have lived the life of a nun  no doubt you
are well drilled in religious forms brocklehurst
who i understand directs lowood is a parson is he
not
yes sir
99
204
jane eyre
and you girls probably worshipped him as a
convent full of religieuses would worship their
director 
oh no 
you are very cool  no  what  a novice not
worship her priest  that sounds blasphemous 
i disliked mr brocklehurst  and i was not
alone in the feeling he is a harsh man  at once
pompous and meddling  he cut off our hair  and
for economys sake bought us bad needles and
thread with which we could hardly sew 
that was very false economy remarked mrs
fairfax who now again caught the drift of the
dialogue
and was that the head and front of his offending   demanded mr rochester
66 he starved us when he had sole superintendence
of the provision department before the committee
was appointed  and he bored us with long lectures
once a week and with evening readings from books
of his own inditing about sudden deaths and judgments which made us afraid to go to bed 
what age were you when you went to lowood  
about ten 
and you stayed there eight years  you are now
then eighteen  
i assented
it
arithmetic you see is useful  without its aid i
should hardly have been able to guess your age
is a point difficult to fix where the features and coun205
jane eyre
tenance are so much at variance as in your case
and now what did you learn at lowood  can you
play
a little 
 of course  that is the established answer go
into the libraryi mean ifyou pleaseexcuse my
tone of command  i am used to say  do this  and it
is done  i cannot alter my customary habits for one
new inmate go then into the library  take a
candle with you  leave the door open  sit down to
the piano and play a tune”
i departed obeying his directions
66 enough   he called out in a few minutes
you play a little i see  like any other english
schoolgirl  perhaps rather better than some but not
well 
i closed the piano and returned mr rochester
continued
adèle showed me some sketches this morning
which she said were yours i dont know whether
they were entirely of your doing  probably a master
aided you 
no indeed   i interjected
ah that pricks pride well fetch me your
portfolio if you can vouch for its contents being
original  but dont pass your word unless you are
certain i can recognize patchwork 
66then i will say nothing and you shall judge for
yourself sir 
i brought the portfolio from the library
206
jane eyre
approach the table said he  and i wheeled it
to his couch adèle and mrs fairfax drew near to
see the pictures
no crowding said mr rochester  take the
drawings from my hand as i finish with them  but
dont push your faces up to mine
he deliberately scrutinized each sketch and painting three he laid aside  the others when he had
examined them he swept from him

take them off to the other table mrs fairfax
said he  and look at them with adèle you
glancing at me  resume your seat and answer my
questions i perceive these pictures were done by
one hand was that hand yours 
yes
and when did you find time to do them  they
have taken much time and some thought 
i did them in the last two vacations i spent at
lowood when i had no other occupation 
where did you get your copies  
out of my head 
that head i see now on your shoulders  
yes sir
66
has it other furniture of the same kind within  
 i should think it may have  i should hopebetter 
he spread the pictures before him and again
surveyed them alternately
while he is so occupied i will tell you reader
what they are  and first i must premise that they are
207
jane eyre
nothing wonderful the subjects had indeed risen
vividly on my mind as i saw them with the
spiritual eye before i attempted to embody them
they were striking  but my hand would not second
my fancy and in each case it had wrought out but a
pale portrait of the thing i had conceived
these pictures were in water colours the first
represented clouds low and livid rolling over a
swollen sea all the distance was in eclipse  so too
was the foreground or rather the nearest billows for
there was no land one gleam of light lifted into
relief a half submerged mast on which sat a
cormorant dark and large with wings flecked with
foam  its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems
that i had touched with as brilliant tints as my
palette could yield and as glittering distinctness as
my pencil could impart sinking below the bird
and mast a drowned corpse glanced through the
green water  a fair arm was the only limb clearly
visible whence the bracelet had been washed or
torn
the second picture contained for foreground only
the dim peak of a hill with grass and some leaves
slanting as if by a breeze beyond and above spread
an expanse of sky dark blue as at twilight  rising
into the sky was a womans shape to the bust portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as i could combine
the dim forehead was crowned with a star  the
lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion
of vapour  the eyes shone dark and wild  the hair
208
jane eyre
streamed shadowy like a beamless cloud torn by
storm or by electric travail on the neck lay a pale
reflection like moonlight  the faint lustre touched
the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed
this vision of the evening star
the third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg
piercing a polar winter sky  a muster of northern
lights reared their dim lances close serried along the
horizon throwing these into distance rose in the
foreground a head a colossal head inclined towards
the iceberg and resting against it two thin hands
joined under the forehead and supporting it drew
up before the lower features a sable veil  a brow
quite bloodless white as bone and an eye hollow
and fixed blank of meaning but for the glassiness of
despair alone was visible above the temples
amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery
vague in its character and consistency as cloud
gleamed a ring of white flame gemmed with sparkles
of a more lurid tinge this pale crescent was  the
likeness of a kingly crown   what it diademed was
 the shape which shape had none ”
were you happy when you painted these
pictures   asked mr rochester presently
 i was absorbed sir  yes and i was happy to
paint them in short was to enjoy one ofthe keenest
pleasures i have ever known 
 that is not saying much your pleasures by
your own account have been few  but i daresay you
did exist in a kind of artists dreamland while you
209 р
jane eyre

blent and arranged these strange tints did you sit
at them long each day
i had nothing else to do because it was the
vacation and i sat at them from morning till noon
and from noon till night  the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply 
and you felt self satisfied with the result of your
ardent labours  
far from it i was tormented by the contrast
between my idea and my handiwork  in each case i
had imagined something which i was quite powerless
to realize 
not quite you have secured the shadow of
your thought  but no more probably you had not
enough of the artists skill and science to give it full
being  yet the drawings are for a schoolgirl
peculiar as to the thoughts they are elfish these
eyes in the evening star you must have seen in a
dream how could you make them look so clear
and yet not at all brilliant  for the planet above
quells their rays and what meaning is that in their
solemn depth  and who taught you to paint wind
there is a high gale in that sky and on this hill top
where did you see latmos  for that is latmos
thereput the drawings away 
i had scarce tied the strings ofthe portfolio when
looking at his watch he said abruptly —
it is nine oclock  what are you about miss
eyre to let adèle sit up so long  take her to
bed
210
jane eyre
adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room 
he endured the caress but scarcely seemed to relish
it more than pilot would have done nor so much
 i wish you all good night now said he making
a movement of the hand towards the door in token
that he was tired of our company and wished to
dismiss us mrs fairfax folded up her knitting  i
took my portfolio  we curtsied to him received a
frigid bow in return and so withdrew
you said mr rochester was not strikingly
peculiar mrs fairfax i observed when i rejoined
her in her room after putting adèle to bed
well is he 
 i think so  he is very changeful and abrupt 
true  no doubt he may appear so to a stranger
but i am so accustomed to his manner  i never think
of it  and then if he has peculiarities of temper
allowance should be made
66
66
why
partly because it is his natureand we can none
of us help our nature  and partly he has painful
thoughts no doubt to harass him and make his
spirits unequal 
what about  
66 family troubles for one thing 
but he has no family
not nowbut he has hador at least relatives
he lost his elder brother a few years since 
 his elder brother 
yes the present mr rochester has not been
211
jane eyre
very long in possession of the property  only about
nine years

nine years is a tolerable time was he so very
fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his
loss  
66 why noperhaps not i believe there were
some misunderstandings between them mr row
land rochester was not quite just to mr edward 
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him
the old gentleman was fond of money and anxious
to keep the family estate together he did not like
to diminish the property by division and yet he was
anxious that mr edward should have wealth too to
keep up the consequence of the name  and soon
after he was of age some steps were taken that were
not quite fair and made a great deal of mischief
old mr rochester and mr rowland combined to
bring mr edward into what he considered a painful
position for the sake of making his fortune  what
the precise nature of that position was i never clearly
knew but his spirit could not brook what he had to
suffer in it he is not very forgiving  he broke
with his family and now for many years he has led
an unsettled kind of life i dont think he has ever
been resident at thornfield for a fortnight together
since the death of his brother without a will left him
master of the estate  and indeed no wonder he
shuns the old place
why should he shun it 
perhaps he thinks it gloomy
212
jane eyre
the answer was evasive i should have liked
something clearer  but mrs fairfax either could
not or would not give me more explicit information
of the origin and nature of mr rochesters trials
she averred they were a mystery to herself and that
what she knew was chiefly from conjecture it was
evident indeed that she wished me to drop the
subject which i did accordingly
213
chapter xiv
for several subsequent days i saw little of mr
rochester in the mornings he seemed much
engaged with business and in the afternoon gentlemen from millcote or the neighbourhood called
and sometimes stayed to dine with him when his
sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise he
rode out a good deal  probably to return these
visits as he generally did not come back till late at
night
during this interval even adèle was seldom sent
for to his presence and all my acquaintance with
him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the
hall on the stairs or in the gallery when he would
sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly just
acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a
cool glance and sometimes bow and smile with
gentlemanlike affability his changes of mood did
not offend me because i saw that i had nothing
to do with their alternation  the ebb and flow
depended on causes quite disconnected with me
one day he had had company to dinner and had
sent for my portfolio  in order doubtless to exhibit
214
jane eyre
its contents  the gentlemen went away early to
attend a public meeting at millcote as mrs fairfax
informed me  but the night being wet and inclement mr rochester did not accompany them
soon after they were gone he rang the bell a
message came that i and adèle were to go downstairs i brushed adèles hair and made her neat
and having ascertained that i was myself in my
usual quaker trim where there was nothing to
retouchall being too close and plain braided
locks included to admit of disarrangementwe
descended adèle wondering whether the petit coffre
was at length come  for owing to some mistake
its arrival had hitherto been delayed she was
gratified  there it stood a little carton on the table
when we entered the diningroom she appeared
to know it by instinct
ma boite  ma boite   exclaimed she running
towards it
yesthere is your  boite  at last  take it into a
corner you genuine daughter of paris and amuse
yourself with disembowelling it said the deep and
rather sarcastic voice of mr rochester proceeding
from the depths of an immense easy chair at the
fireside and mind he continued  dont bother
me with any details of the anatomical process or any
notice of the condition of the entrails  let your
operation be conducted in silence  tienstoi tranquille enfant  comprendstu  
adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning  she
215
jane eyre
had already retired to a sofa with her treasure and
was busy untying the cord which secured the lid
having removed this impediment and lifted certain
silvery envelopes of tissue paper she merely
exclaimed 
oh ciel  que cest beau   and then remained
absorbed in ecstatic contemplation
 is miss eyre there   now demanded the master
half rising from his seat to look round to the door
near which i still stood
ah well  come forward  be seated here he
drew a chair near his own i am not fond of the
prattle of children he continued  for old
bachelor as i am i have no pleasant associations
connected with their lisp it would be intolerable
to me to pass a whole evening têteatête with a brat
dont draw that chair further off miss eyre  sit
down exactly where i placed itif you please that
is confound these civilities  i continually forget
them nor do i particularly affect simpleminded
old ladies by thebye i must have mine in mind 
it wont do to neglect her  she is a fairfax or
wed to one  and blood is said to be thicker than
water 
he rang and despatched an invitation to mrs
fairfax who soon arrived knittingbasket in hand
good evening madam  i sent to you for a
charitable purpose  i have forbidden adèle to talk
to me about her presents and she is bursting with
repletion  have the goodness to serve her as
216
jane eyre
auditress and interlocutrice  it will be one of the
most benevolent acts you ever performed
adèle indeed no sooner saw mrs fairfax than
she summoned her to her sofa and there quickly
filled her lap with the porcelain the ivory the
waxen contents of her  boite   pouring out meantime explanations and raptures in such broken
english as she was mistress of
now i have performed the part of a good host
pursued mr rochester   put my guests into the
way of amusing each other i ought to be at liberty
to attend to my own pleasure miss eyre draw your
chair still a little further forward  you are yet too
far back  i cannot see you without disturbing my
position in this comfortable chair which i have no
mind to do 
i did as i was bid though i would much rather
have remained somewhat in the shade  but mr
rochester had such a direct way of giving orders it
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly
we were as i have said in the diningroom  the
lustre which had been lit for dinner filled the room
with a festal breadth of light  the large fire was all
red and clear  the purple curtains hung rich and
ample before the lofty window and loftier arch 
everything was still save the subdued chat of adèle
she dared not speak loud  and filling up each
pause the beating of winter rain against the
panes
mr rochester as he sat in his damaskcovered
217
jane eyre
chair looked different to what i had seen him look
before  not quite so sternmuch less gloomy
there was a smile on his lips and his eyes sparkled
whether with wine or not i am not sure  but i
think it very probable he was in short in his
afterdinner mood  more expanded and genial and
also more self indulgent than the frigid and rigid
temper of the morning  still he looked preciously
grim cushioning his massive head against the
swelling back of his chair and receiving the light
of the fire on his granitehewn features and in his
great dark eyes  for he had great dark eyes and
very fine eyes toonot without a certain change in
their depths sometimes which if it was not softness
reminded you at least of that feeling
he had been looking two minutes at the fire and
i had been looking the same length of time at him
when turning suddenly he caught my gaze fastened
on his physiognomy
you examine me miss eyre said he   do you
think me handsome  
i should if i had deliberated have replied to this
question by something conventionally vague and
polite  but the answer somehow slipped from my
tongue before i was aware  no sir 
 ah  by my word  there is something singular
about you said he  you have the air of a little
nonette  quaint quiet grave and simple as you sit
with your hands before you and your eyes generally
bent on the carpet except bythebye when they
218
jane eyre
are directed piercingly to my face  as just now for
instance  and when one asks you a question or
makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply
you rap out a round rejoinder which if not blunt
is at least brusque what do you mean by it  
sir i was too plain  i beg your pardon i ought
to have replied that it was not easy to give an
impromptu answer to a question about appearances 
that tastes differ  that beauty is of little consequence or something of that sort 
you ought to have replied no such thing
beauty oflittle consequence indeed  and so under
pretence of softening the previous outrage of
stroking and soothing me into placidity you stick a
sly penknife under my ear  go on  what fault do
you find with me pray  i suppose i have all my
limbs and all features like any other man  
mr rochester allow me to disown my first
answer  i intended no pointed repartee  it was
only a blunder 
just so i think so  and you shall be answerable for it criticize me  does my forehead not
please you  
he lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay
horizontally over his brow and showed a solid
enough mass of intellectual organs but an abrupt
deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence
should have risen
now maam am i a fool  
 far from it sir you would perhaps think me
219
jane eyre
rude if i inquired in return whether you are a
philanthropist 
there again  another stick of the penknife
when she pretended to pat my head  and that is
because i said i did not like the society of children
and old women low be it spoken   no young
lady i am not a general philanthropist  but i bear
a conscience   and he pointed to the prominences
which are said to indicate that faculty and which
fortunately for him were sufficiently conspicuous 
giving indeed a marked breadth to the upper part
of his head   and besides i once had a kind of
rude tenderness of heart when i was as old as
you i was a feeling fellow enough  partial to the
unfledged unfostered and unlucky  but fortune
has knocked me about since she has even kneaded
me with her knuckles and now i flatter myself i am
hard and tough as an indiarubber ball  pervious
though through a chink or two still and with one
sentient point in the middle of the lump yes 
does that leave hope for me 
hope of what sir  
 of my final retransformation from india rubber
back to flesh  
 decidedly he has had too much wine  i thought 
and i did not know what answer to make to his
queer question  how could i tell whether he was
capable of being re transformed 
you look very much puzzled miss eyre  and
though you are not pretty any more than i am
220
jane eyre
handsome yet a puzzled air becomes you  besides
it is convenient for it keeps those searching eyes of
yours away from my physiognomy and busies them
with the worsted flowers of the rug  so puzzle on
young lady i am disposed to be gregarious and
communicative to night 
with this announcement he rose from his chair
and stood leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
well as his face  his unusual breadth of chest
disproportionate almost to his length of limb i
am sure most people would have thought him an
ugly man  yet there was so much unconscious pride
in his port  so much ease in his demeanour  such a
look of complete indifference to his own external
appearance  so haughty a reliance on the power of
other qualities intrinsic or adventitious to atone
for the lack of mere personal attractiveness that in
looking at him one inevitably shared the indifference
and even in a blind imperfect sense put faith in
the confidence

i am disposed to be gregarious and communicative tonight  he repeated   and that is why i sent
for you the fire and the chandelier were not
sufficient company for me  nor would pilot have
been for none of these can talk adèle is a degree
better but still far below the mark  mrs fairfax
ditto  you i am persuaded can suit me if you will 
you puzzled me the first evening i invited you down
here i have almost forgotten you since  other
221
jane eyre
ideas have driven yours from my head  but tonight
i am resolved to be at ease  to dismiss what
importunes and recall what pleases it would please
me now to drawyou out to learn more of youtherefore speak 
instead of speaking i smiled  and not a very complacent or submissive smile either
speak he urged
what about sir  
whatever you like i leave both the choice of
subject and the manner of treating it entirely to
yourself 
accordingly i sat and said nothing  if he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and
showing off he will find he has addressed himself to
the wrong person i thought
you are dumb miss eyre
i was dumb still he bent his head a little
towards me and with a single hasty glance seemed
to dive into my eyes
stubborn   he said  and annoyed ah it is
consistent i put my request in an absurd almost
insolent form miss eyre i beg your pardon the
fact is once for all i dont wish to treat you like
an inferior  that is  correcting himself   i claim
only such superiority as must result from twenty
years difference in age and a centurys advance in
experience this is legitimate et jy tiens as adèle
would say and it is by virtue of this superiority and
this alone that i desire you to have the goodness to
222
jane eyre
talk to me a little now and divert my thoughts
which are galled with dwelling on one pointcankering as a rusty nail 
he had deigned an explanation  almost an
apology  i did not feel insensible to his condescension and would not seem so
i am willing to amuse you if i can sir  quite
willing  but i cannot introduce a topic because
how do i know what will interest you  ask me
questions and i will do my best to answer them 
then in the first place do you agree with me
that i have a right to be a little masterful abrupt 
perhaps exacting sometimes on the grounds i
stated  namely that i am old enough to be your
father and that i have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations and roamed
over half the globe while you have lived quietly with
one set of people in one house  
do as you please sir 
 that is no answer  or rather it is a very irritating because a very evasive one reply clearly
 i dont think sir you have a right to command
me merely because you are older than i or because
you have seen more of the world than i have  your
claim to superiority depends on the use you have
made of your time and experience 
 humph  promptly spoken but i wont allow
that seeing that it would never suit my case  as i
have made an indifferent not to say a bad use of
both advantages leaving superiority out of the
223
jane eyre
question then you must still agree to receive my
orders now and then without being piqued or hurt
by the tone of commandwill you  
i smiled i thought to myself mr rochester is
peculiar he seems to forget that he pays me £30
per annum for receiving his orders
66the smile is very well  said he catching instantly the passing expression   but speak too 
i was thinking sir that very few masters would
trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their
paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their
orders 
paid subordinates  what you are my paid
subordinate are you  oh yes i had forgotten the
salary  well then on that mercenary ground will
you agree to let me hector a little  
no sir not on that ground  but on the ground
that you did forget it and that you care whether or
not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency i
agree heartily 
and will you consent to dispense with a great
many conventional forms and phrases without thinking that the omission arises from insolence 
“ i am sure sir i should never mistake informality
for insolence  one i rather like the other nothing
free born would submit to even for a salary
humbug most things freeborn will submit to
anything for a salary  therefore keep to yourself
and dont venture on generalities of which you are
intensely ignorant however i mentally shake
224
jane eyre
hands with you for your answer despite its inaccuracy 
and as much for the manner in which it was said as
for the substance of the speech  the manner was
frank and sincere  one does not often see such a
manner  no on the contrary affectation or coldness
or stupid coarseminded misapprehension of ones
meaning are the usual rewards of candour not
three in three thousand raw schoolgirlgovernesses
would have answered me as you have just done but
i dont mean to flatter you if you are cast in a
different mould to the majority it is no merit of
yours  nature did it and then after all i go too
fast in my conclusions  for what i yet know you
may be no better than the rest  you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good
points 
and so may you i thought my eye met his as
the idea crossed my mind  he seemed to read the
glance answering as if its import had been spoken
as well as imagined 

“ yes yes you are right said he   i have plenty
of faults of my own  i know it and i dont wish to
palliate them i assure you god wot i need not
be too severe about others  i have a past existence 
a series of deeds a colour of life to contemplate
within myownbreast which might well call my sneers
and censures from my neighbours to myself i
started or rather for like other defaulters i like to
lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of
225 q
jane eyre
oneandtwenty and have never recovered the right
course since but i might have been very different 
i might have been as good as youwiseralmost as
stainless i envy you your peace of mind your clean
conscience your unpolluted memory little girl a
memory without blot or contamination must be an
exquisite treasurean inexhaustible source of pure
refreshment  is it not  
how was your memory when you were eighteen
sir  
all right then  limpid salubrious  no gush of
bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle i was
your equal at eighteenquite your equal nature
meant me to be on the whole a good man miss
eyre  one ofthe better end  and you see i am not
so you would say you dont see it  at least i
flatter myself i read as much in your eye beware
bythebye what you express with that organ i am
quick at interpreting its language then take my
word for it i am not a villain you are not to
suppose that not to attribute to me any such bad
eminence  but owing i verily believe rather to circumstances than to my natural bent i am a trite
commonplace sinner hackneyed in all the poor petty
dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to
put on life do you wonder that i avow this to you 
know that in the course of your future life you will
often find yourself elected the involuntary confidante
of your acquaintances secrets  people will instinctively find out as i have done that it is not your
226
jane eyre
forte to tell of yourself but to listen while others
talk of themselves  they will feel too that you listen
with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion but
with a kind of innate sympathy not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive
in its manifestations
how do you know how can you guess all this
sir  
i know it well  therefore i proceed almost as
freely as if i were writing my thoughts in a diary
you would say i should have been superior to circumstances  so i shouldso i should  but you see
i was not when fate wronged me i had not the
wisdom to remain cool  i turned desperate  then i
degenerated now when any vicious simpleton
excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry i cannot
flatter myself that i am better than he  i am forced
to confess that he and i are on a level i wish i had
stood firmgod knows i do  dread remorse when
you are tempted to err miss eyre  remorse is the
poison of life
66 repentance is said to be its cure sir 
it is not its cure reformation may be its cure 
and i could reformi have strength yet for thatif
but where is the use of thinking of it hampered
burdened cursed as i am besides since happiness
is irrevocably denied me i have a right to get
pleasure out of life  and i will get it cost what it
may 
 then you will degenerate still more sir 
227
jane eyre
possibly  yet why should i if i can get sweet
and fresh pleasure  and i may get it as sweet and
fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
moor
 it will stingit will taste bitter sir 
how do you know you never tried it how
very serioushow very solemn you look  and you
are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head 
taking one from the mantelpiece   you have no
right to preach to me you neophyte that have not
passed the porch of life and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries
i only remind you of your own words sir  you
said error brought remorse and you pronounced
remorse the poison of existence 
error
and who talks of error now  i scarcely think
the notion that flittered across my brain was an
i believe it was an inspiration rather than a
temptation it was very genial very soothingi
know that here it comes again  it is no devil  i
assure you  or if it be it has put on the robes of an
angel of light i think i must admit so fair a guest
when it asks entrance to my heart 
distrust it sir  it is not a true angel
once more how do you know by what instinct
do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen
seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
eternal thronebetween a guide and a seducer  
i judged by your countenance sir which was
troubled when you said the suggestion had returned
228
jane eyre
upon you i feel sure it will work you more misery
if you listen to it
not at allit bears the most gracious message
in the world for the rest you are not my consciencekeeper so dont make yourself uneasy here come
in bonny wanderer  
he said this as if he spoke to a vision viewless to
any eye but his own  then folding his arms which
he had half extended on his chest he seemed to
enclose in their embrace the invisible being
now he continued again addressing me  i
have received the pilgrima disguised deity as i
verily believe already it has done me good  my
heart was a sort of charnel  it will now be a shrine
to speak truth sir i dont understand you at
all  i cannot keep up the conversation because it
has got out of my depth only one thing i know 
you said you were not as good as you should like to
be and that you regretted your own imperfection —
one thing i can comprehend  you intimated that to
have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane it
seems to me that if you tried hard you would in
time find it possible to become what you yourself
would approve  and that if from this day you began
with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions
you would in a few years have laid up a new and
stainless store of recollections to which you might
revert with pleasure 
“
 justly thought  rightly said miss eyre  and at
this moment i am paving hell with energy
229
jane eyre
sir 
 i am laying down good intentions which i
believe durable as flint certainly my associates
and pursuits shall be other than they have been 
and better 
 and betterso much better as pure ore is than
foul dross you seem to doubt me  i dont doubt
myself i know what my aim is what my motives
are  and at this moment i pass a law unalterable as
that of the medes and persians that both are right 
they cannot be sir if they require a new statute
to legalize them 
they are miss eyre though they absolutely
require a new statute  unheard of combinations of
circumstances demand unheard of rules
 that sounds a dangerous maxim sir  because
one can see at once that it is liable to abuse
sententious sage  so it is  but i swear by my
household gods not to abuse it 
you are human and fallible 
 i am so are youwhat then 
the human and fallible should not arrogate a
power with which the divine and perfect alone can
be safely entrusted 
what power  
that of saying of any strange unsanctioned line
of action let it be right
 let it be right the very words  you have
pronounced them
66 may it be right then  i said as i rose deeming
230
jane eyre
it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me  and besides sensible that the character
of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration  at
least beyond its present reach  and feeling the
uncertainty the vague sense of insecurity which
accompanies a conviction of ignorance
where are you going 
to put adèle to bed  it is past her bed time 
you are afraid of me because i talk like a
sphinx 
 your language is enigmatical sir  but though i
am bewildered i am certainly not afraid
you are afraidyour selflove dreads a blunder 
in that sense i do feel apprehensivei have no
wish to talk nonsense 
if you did it would be in such a grave quiet
manner i should mistake it for sense doyou never
laugh miss eyre  dont trouble yourself to answer
i see you laugh rarely  but you can laugh very
merrily believe me you are not naturally austere
any more than i am naturally vicious the lowood
constraint still clings to you somewhat  controlling
your features muffling your voice and restricting
your limbs  and you fear in the presence of a man
and a brother or father or master or what you
willto smile too gaily speak too freely or move too
quickly but in time i think you will learn to be
natural with me as i find it impossible to be conventional with you  and then your looks and movements
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare
231
jane eyre
offer now i see at intervals the glance of a curious
sort of bird through the closeset bars of a cage  a
vivid restless resolute captive is there  were it but
free it would soar cloudhigh you are still bent on
going
 it has struck nine sir 
never mindwait a minute  adèle is not ready
to go to bed yet my position miss eyre with my
back to the fire and my face to the room favours
observation while talking to you i have also
occasionally watched adèle   i have my own reasons
for thinking her a curious studyreasons that i may
nay that i shallimpart to you some day  she
pulled out of her box about ten minutes ago a little
pink silk frock  rapture lit her face as she unfolded
it  coquetry runs in her blood blends with her
brains and seasons the marrow of her bones  il
faut que je lessaie   cried she   et à linstant
même  and she rushed out of the room she is
now with sophie undergoing a robing process in a
few minutes she will reenter  and i know what i
shall see a miniature of céline varens as she used
to appear on the boards at the rising of  but never
mind that however my tenderest feelings are
about to receive a shock  such is my presentiment 
stay now to see whether it will be realized 
ere long adèles little foot was heard tripping
across the hall she entered transformed as her
guardian had predicted a dress of rosecoloured
satin very short and as full in the skirt as it could
232
jane eyre
be gathered replaced the brown frock she had
previously worn  a wreath of rosebuds circled her
forehead  her feet were dressed in silk stockings
and small white satin sandals
estce que ma robe va bien   cried she bounding forwards  et mes souliers  et mes bas  tenez
je crois que je vais danser  
and spreading out her dress she chasséed across
the room  till having reached mr rochester she
wheeled lightly round before him on tiptoe then
dropped on one knee at his feet exclaiming —

monsieur je vous remercie mille fois de votre
bonté   then rising she added  cest comme cela
que maman faisait nest ce pas monsieur  
 precisely   was the answer   and  comme
cela she charmed my english gold out of my
british breeches pocket i have been green too
miss eyreay grass green  not a more vernal tint
freshens you now than once freshened me my
spring is gone however but it has left me that
french floweret on my hands  which in some moods
i would fain be rid of not valuing now the root
it sprang  having found that it was of a sort which
nothing but gold dust could manure i have but half
a liking to the blossom  especially when it looks so
artificial as just now i keep it and rear it rather on
the roman catholic principle of expiating numerous
sins great or small by one good work ill explain
all this some day good night 
233
chapter xv
mr rochester did on a future occasion explain it
it was one afternoon when he chanced to meet
me and adèle in the grounds  and while she played
with pilot and her shuttlecock he asked me to walk
up and down a long beech avenue within sight of
her
he then said that she was the daughter of a
french opera dancer céline varens towards whom
he had once cherished what he called a  grande
passion  this passion céline had professed to
return with even superior ardour he thought
himself her idol ugly as he was  he believed as he
said that she preferred his taille dathlète  to the
elegance of the apollo belvidere
66 and miss eyre so much was i flattered by this
preference of the gallic sylph for her british gnome
that i installed her in an hotel gave her a complete
establishment of servants a carriage cashmeres
diamonds dentelles etc in short i began the
process of ruining myself in the received style like
any other spoony i had not it seems the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruc234
jane eyre
i
tion but trod the old track with stupid exactness
not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre
had as i deserved to have the fate of all other
spoonies happening to call one evening when
céline did not expect me i found her out  but it
was a warm night and i was tired with strolling
through paris so i sat down in her boudoir  happy
to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her
presence noi exaggerate  i never thought there
was any consecrating virtue about her  it was rather
a sort of pastille perfume she had left  a scent of
musk and amber rather than an odour of sanctity
i was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences when i
bethought myself to open the window and step out
on to the balcony it was moonlight and gaslight
besides and very still and serene the balcony was
furnished with a chair or two  i sat down took out
a cigari will take one now if you will excuse me 
here ensued a pause filled up by the producing
and lighting of a cigar  having placed it to his lips
and breathed a trail of havannah incense on the
freezing and sunless air he went on 
i liked bonbons too in those days miss eyre
and i was croquant overlook the barbarism—
croquant chocolate comfits and smoking alternately
watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring
opera house when in an elegant close carriage
drawn by a beautiful pair of english horses and
235
jane eyre
distinctly seen in the brilliant citynight i recognized
the voiture  i had given céline she was returning of course my heart thumped with impatience
against the iron rails i leant upon the carriage
stopped as i had expected at the hotel door  my
flame that is the very word for an opera inamorata
alighted though muffled in a cloakan unnecessary
encumbrance bythebye on so warm a june evening
i knew her instantly by her little foot seen
peeping from the skirt of her dress as she skipped
from the carriage step bending over the balcony
i was about to murmur  mon ange  in a tone of
course which should be audible to the ear of love
alonewhen a figure jumped from the carriage after
her  cloaked also  but that was a spurred heel
which had rung on the pavement and that was a
hatted head which now passed under the arched
porte cochère of the hotel
you never felt jealousy did you miss eyre 
of course not  i need not ask you  because you
never felt love you have both sentiments yet to
experience your soul sleeps  the shock is yet to be
given which shall waken it you think all existence
lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth
has hitherto slid away floating on with closed
eyes and muffled ears you neither see the rocks
bristling not far off in the bed of the flood nor hear
the breakers boil at their base but i tell youand
you may mark my wordsyou will come some day to
a craggy pass of the channel where the whole of lifes
236
jane eyre
stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult
foam and noise  either you will be dashed to atoms
on crag points or lifted up and borne on by some
master wave into a calmer current as i am now
i like this day  i like that sky of steel  i like
the sternness and stillness of the world under this
frost i like thornfield  its antiquity  its retirement  its old crowtrees and thorntrees  its grey
façade and lines of dark windows reflecting that
metal welkin and yet how long have i abhorred the
very thought of it  shunned it like a great plaguehouse  how i do still abhor

he ground his teeth and was silent  he arrested
his step and struck his boot against the hard ground
some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip
and to hold him so tightly that he could not
advance
we were ascending the avenue when he thus
paused  the hall was before us lifting his eye to
its battlements he cast over them a glare such as i
never saw before or since pain shame ireimpatience disgust detestationseemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil
dilating under his ebon eyebrow wild was the
wrestle which should be paramount  but another
feeling rose and triumphed  something hard and
cynical  self willed and resolute  it settled his
passion and petrified his countenance  he went
on 
66 during the moment i was silent miss eyre i
237
jane eyre
was arranging a point with my destiny she stood
there by that beechtrunk—a hag like one of those
who appeared to macbeth on the heath of forres
you like thornfield   she said lifting her finger 
and then she wrote in the air a memento which ran
in lurid hieroglyphics all along the housefront
between the upper and lower row of windows
 like it if you can    like it if you dare  
 i will like it  said i i dare like it   and  he
subjoined moodily  i will keep my word  i will
break obstacles to happiness to goodnessyes goodness  i wish to be a better man than i have been 
than i am as jobs leviathan broke the spear the
dart and the habergeon hindrances which others
count as iron and brass i will esteem but straw and
rotten wood 
adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock
away   he cried harshly   keep at a distance
child  or go in to sophie   continuing then to
pursue his walk in silence i ventured to recall him
to the point whence he had abruptly diverged
did you leave the balcony sir i asked  when
mdlle varens entered  
i almost expected a rebuff for this hardly welltimed question  but on the contrary waking out of
his scowling abstraction he turned his eyes towards
me and the shade seemed to clear off his brow
oh i had forgotten céline  well to resume
when i saw my charmer thus come in accompanied
by a cavalier i seemed to hear a hiss and the green
238
jane eyre
snake ofjealousy rising on undulating coils from the
moonlit balcony glided within my waistcoat and
ate its way in two minutes to my hearts core
strange   he exclaimed suddenly starting again
from the point  strange that i should choose you
for the confidante of all this young lady  passing
strange that you should listen to me quietly as if it
were the most usual thing in the world for a man like
me to tell stories of his operamistresses to a quaint
inexperienced girl like you  but the last singularity
explains the first as i intimated once before  you
with your gravity considerateness and caution were
made to be the recipient of secrets besides i
know what sort of a mind i have placed in communication with my own  i know it is one not liable to
take infection  it is a peculiar mind  it is an unique
one happily i do not mean to harm it  but if i
did it would not take harm from me the more
you and i converse the better  for while i cannot
blight you you may refresh me  after this
digression he proceeded 

i remained in the balcony they will come
to her boudoir no doubt  thought i   let me prepare an ambush  so putting my hand in through
the open window i drew the curtain over it leaving
only an opening through which i could take observations  then i closed the casement all but a chink
just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers
whispered vows  then i stole back to my chair and as
i resumed it the pair came in my eye was quickly at
239
jane eyre
the aperture celines chambermaid entered lit a
lamp left it on the table and withdrew the couple
were thus revealed to me clearly  both removed
their cloaks  and there was the varens shining
in satin and jewelsmy gifts of courseand there
was her companion in an officers uniform  and i
knew him for a young roué of a vicomtea brainless
and vicious youth whom i had sometimes met in
society and had never thought of hating because i
despised him so absolutely on recognizing him
the fang of the snake jealousy was instantly broken 
because at the same moment my love for céline sank
under an extinguisher a woman who could betray
me for such a rival was not worth contending for 
she deserved only scorn  less however than i who
had been her dupe
they began to talk  their conversation eased
me completely frivolous mercenary heartless and
senseless it was rather calculated to weary than
enrage a listener a card of mine lay on the table 
this being perceived brought my name under discussion neither of them possessed energy or wit
to belabour me soundly  but they insulted me as
coarsely as they could in their little wayespecially
céline  who even waxed rather brilliant on mypersonal
defects deformities she termed them now it had
been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my  beauté mâle   wherein
she differed diametrically from you who told me
point blank at the second interview that you did
240
jane eyre
not think me handsome
the time and
the contrast struck me at
adèle here came running up again
66 monsieur john has just been to say that your
agent has called and wishes to see you 
 ah  in that case i must abridge opening the
window i walked in upon them  liberated céline
from my protection  gave her notice to vacate her
hotel  offered her a purse for immediate exigencies  disregarded screams hysterics prayers protestations convulsions  made an appointment with
the vicomte for a meeting at the bois de boulogne
next morning i had the pleasure of encountering
him  left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms
feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip and then
thought i had done with the whole crew but
unluckily the varens six months before had given
me this filette adèle  who she affirmed was my
daughter and perhaps she may be though i see no
proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance  pilot is more like me than she some years
after i had broken with the mother she abandoned
her child and ran away to italy with a musician or
singer i acknowledged no natural claim on adèles
part to be supported by me  nor do i now acknowledge any for i am not her father  but hearing that
she was quite destitute i een took the poor thing
out of the slime and mud of paris and transplanted
it here to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
english country garden mrs fairfax found you to
241 r
jane eyre
train it  but now you know that it is the illegitimate
offspring of a french operagirl you will perhaps
think differently of your post and protégée  you will
be coming to me some day with notice that you have
found another place that you beg me to look out
for a new governess etceh 
no adèle is not answerable for either her
mothers faults or yours  i have a regard for her
and now that i know that she is in a sense parentlessforsaken by her mother and disowned by you
siri shall cling closer to her than before how
could i possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy
family who would hate her governess as a nuisance
to a lonely little orphan who leans towards her as a
friend 
 oh that is the light in which you view it  well
i must go in now  and you too  it darkens 
but i stayed out a few minutes longer with adèle
and pilotran a race with her and played a game
of battledore and shuttlecock when we went in
and i had removed her bonnet and coat i took her
on my knee kept her there an hour allowing her to
prattle as she liked  not rebuking even some little
freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
stray when much noticed and which betrayed in her
a superficiality of character inherited probably from
her mother hardly congenial to an english mind
still she had her merits  and i was disposed to
appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost i
sought in her countenance and features a likeness to
242
jane eyre
mr rochester but found none  no trait no turn of
expression announced relationship it was a pity 
if she could but have been proved to resemble him
he would have thought more of her
it was not till after i had withdrawn to my own
chamber for the night that i steadily reviewed the
tale mr rochester had told me as he had said
there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the
substance ofthe narrative itself  a wealthy englishmans passion for a french dancer and her treachery
to him were everyday matters enough no doubt in
society  but there was something decidedly strange
in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly
seized him when he was in the act of expressing the
present contentment of his mood and his newly
revived pleasures in the old hall and its environs i
meditated wonderingly on this incident  but gradually quitting it as i found it for the present inexplicable i turned to the consideration of my masters
manner to myself the confidence he had thought
fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion  i regarded and accepted it as such his
deportment had now for some weeks been more
uniform towards me than at the first i never seemed
in his way  he did not take fits of chilling hauteur 
when he met me unexpectedly the encounter seemed
welcome he had always a word and sometimes a
smile for me  when summoned by formal invitation
to his presence i was honoured by a cordiality of
reception that made me feel i really possessed the
243
jane eyre
power to amuse him and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for
my benefit
i indeed talked comparatively little  but i heard
him talk with relish it was his nature to be communicative  he liked to open to a mind unacquainted
with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways i do
not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways but
such as derived their interest from the great scale on
which they were acted the strange novelty by which
they were characterized  and i had a keen delight
in receiving the new ideas he offered in imagining
the new pictures he portrayed and following him in
thought through the new regions he disclosed never
startled or troubled by one noxious allusion
the ease of his manner freed me from painful
restraint  the friendly frankness as correct as
cordial with which he treated me drew me to him
i felt at times as if he were my relation rather than
my master  yet he was imperious sometimes still 
but i did not mind that  i saw it was his way so
happy so gratified did i become with this new
interest added to life that i ceased to pine after
kindred my thin crescentdestiny seemed to enlarge  the blanks of existence were filled up  my
bodily health improved  i gathered flesh and
strength
and was mr rochester now ugly in my eyes 
no reader  gratitude and many associations all
pleasurable and genial made his face the object i
244
jane eyre
best liked to see  his presence in a room was more
cheering than the brightest fire yet i had not
forgotten his faults  indeed i could not for he
brought them frequently before me he was proud
sardonic harsh to inferiority of every description  in
my secret soul i knew that his great kindness to me
was balanced by unjust severity to many others he
was moody too  unaccountably so  i more than
once when sent for to read to him found him sitting
in his library alone with his head bent on his folded
arms  and when he looked up a morose almost a
malignant scowl blackened his features but i
believed that his moodiness his harshness and his
former faults of morality i say former for now he
seemed corrected of them had their source in some
cruel cross of fate i believed he was naturally
a man of better tendencies higher principles and
purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed education instilled or destiny encouraged i
thought there were excellent materials in him 
though for the present they hung together somewhat
spoiled and tangled i cannot deny that i grieved
for his grief whatever that was and would have
given much to assuage it
though i had now extinguished my candle and
was laid down in bed i could not sleep for thinking
of his look when he paused in the avenue and told
how his destiny had risen up before him and dared
him to be happy at thornfield
why not   i asked myself
what alienates
245 1
jane eyre
him from the house  will he leave it again soon 
mrs fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
a fortnight at a time  and he has now been resident
eight weeks if he does go the change will be
doleful suppose he should be absent spring
summer and autumn  how joyless sunshine and
fine days will seem  
i hardly know whether i had slept or not after this
musing  at any rate i started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur peculiar and lugubrious which
sounded i thought just above me i wished i had
kept my candle burning  the night was drearily
dark  my spirits were depressed i rose and sat up
in bed listening the sound was hushed
i tried again to sleep  but my heart beat
anxiously my inward tranquillity was broken the
clock far down in the hall struck two just then
it seemed my chamberdoor was touched  as if fingers
had swept the panels in groping a way along the
dark gallery outside i said  who is there  
nothing answered i was chilled with fear
all at once i remembered that it might be pilot 
who when the kitchendoor chanced to be left open
not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold
of mr rochesters chamber  i had seen him lying
there myself in the mornings the idea calmed me
somewhat i lay down silence composes the
nerves  and as an unbroken hush nowreigned again
through the whole house i began to feel the return
of slumber but it was not fated that i should sleep
246
jane eyre
that night a dream had scarcely approached my
ear when it fled affrighted scared by a marrowfreezing incident enough
this was a demoniac laughlow suppressed and
deeputtered as it seemed at the very keyhole of
my chamber door the head of my bed was near
the door and i thought at first the goblinlaugher
stood at my bedsideor rather crouched by my
pillow but i rose looked round and could see
nothing  while as i still gazed the unnatural sound
was reiterated  and i knew it came from behind the
panels my first impulse was to rise and fasten the
bolt  my next again to cry out  who is there  
something gurgled and moaned ere long steps
retreated up the gallery towards the third storey
staircase a door had lately been made to shut in
that staircase  i heard it open and close and all was
still
i
was that grace poole  and is she possessed with
a devil   thought i impossible now to remain
longer by myself i must go to mrs fairfax
hurried on my frock and a shawl  i withdrew the
bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand
there was a candle burning just outside and on the
matting in the gallery i was surprised at this
circumstance  but still more was i amazed to perceive the air quite dim as if filled with smoke  and
while looking to the right hand and left to find
whence these blue wreaths issued i became further
aware of a strong smell of burning
247
jane eyre
something creaked  it was a door ajar  and that
door was mr rochesters and the smoke rushed in
a cloud from thence i thought no more of mrs
fairfax  i thought no more of grace poole or the
laugh in an instant i was within the chamber
tongues of flame darted round the bed  the curtains
were on fire in the midst of blaze and vapour mr
rochester lay stretched and motionless in deep
sleep
wake  wake   i criedi shook him but he
only murmured and turned  the smoke had stupefied
him not a moment could be lost the very sheets
were kindling i rushed to his basin and ewer 
fortunately one was wide and the other deep and
both were filled with water i heaved them up
deluged the bed and its occupant flew back to my
own room brought my own waterjug baptized the
couch afresh and by gods aid succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it
the hiss of the quenched element the breakage
of a pitcher which i flung from my hand when i had
emptied it and above all the splash of the showerbath i had liberally bestowed roused mr rochester
at last though it was now dark i knew he was
awake  because i heard him fulminating strange
anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool ofwater
 is there a flood   he cried
no sir i answered  but there has been a fire 
get up do you are quenched now  i will fetch you
a candle 
248
jane eyre
in the name of all the elves in christendom is
that jane eyre  he demanded
what have you
done with me witch sorceress  who is in the room
besides you  have you plotted to drown me  
 i will fetch you a candle sir  and in heavens
name get up somebody has plotted something 
you cannot too soon find out who and what it is 
there i am up now but at your peril you fetch
a candle yet  wait two minutes till i get into some
dry garments if any dry there beyes here is my
dressinggown now run  
i did run  i brought the candle which still
remained in the gallery he took it from my hand
held it up and surveyed the bed all blackened and
scorched the sheets drenched the carpet round
swimming in water
what is it  and who did it  he asked
i briefly related to him what had transpired  the
strange laugh i had heard in the gallery  the step
ascending to the third storey  the smokethe smell
of fire which had conducted me to his room  in what
state i had found matters there and how i had
deluged him with all the water i could lay hands on
he listened very gravely  his face as i went on
expressed more than astonishment  he did not
immediately speak when i had concluded
shall i call mrs fairfax  i asked
mrs fairfax  no  what the deuce would you
call her for  what can she do  let her sleep unmolested 
249
jane eyre
 then i will fetch leah and wake john and his
wife 
not at all just be still you have a shawl on 
if you are not warm enough you may take my cloak
yonder  wrap it about you and sit down on my armchair there i will put it on now place your
feet on the stool to keep them out of the wet i
am going to leave you a few minutes i shall take
the candle remain where you are till i return  be
as still as a mouse i must pay a visit to the second
storey dont move remember or call anyone
he went  i watched the light withdraw he
passed up the gallery very softly unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible shut it after
him and the last ray vanished i was left in total
darkness i listened for some noise but heard
nothing a very long time elapsed i grew weary 
it was cold in spite of the cloak  and then i did not
see the use of staying as i was not to rouse the
house i was on the point of risking mr rochesters
displeasure by disobeying his orders when the light
once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall and
i heard his unshod feet tread the matting  i
hope it is he thought i  and not something
worse
he reentered pale and very gloomy  i have
found it all out said he setting his candle down on
the washstand   it is as i thought 
how sir  
he made no reply but stood with his arms folded
250
jane eyre
looking on the ground at the end of a few minutes
he inquired in rather a peculiar tone —
i forget whether you said you sawanything when
you opened your chamber door
no sir only the candlestick on the ground 
but you heard an odd laugh  you have heard
that laugh before i should think or something like
it
66 yes sir  there is a woman who sews here called
grace pooleshe laughs in that way she is a
singular person 
justso grace pooleyou have guessed it she
is as you say singular very well i shall reflect on
the subject meantime i am glad that you are the
only person besides myself acquainted with the precise details ofto nights incident you are no talking
fool say nothing about it i will account for this
state of affairs  pointing to the bed   and now
return to your own room i shall do very well on
the sofa in the library for the rest of the night
it is near fourin two hours the servants will be
up
good night then sir  said i departing
he seemed surprisedvery inconsistently so as he
had just told me to go
what he exclaimed  are you quitting me
already and in that way
you said i might go sir 
but not without taking leave  not without a
word or two of acknowledgment and goodwill  not
251
jane eyre
in short in that brief dry fashion why you have
saved my life snatched me from a horrible and
excruciating death —and you walk past me as if we
were mutual strangers  at least shake hands ”
he held out his hand  i gave him mine  he took
it first in one then in both his own
you have saved my life  i have a pleasure in
owing you so immense a debt i cannot say more
nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an
obligation but you  it is different i feel your
benefits no burden jane 
he paused  gazed at me  words almost visible
trembled on his lips—but his voice was checked
goodnight again sir there is no debt benefit
burden obligation in the case 
 i knew he continued  you would do me good
in some way at some time  i saw it in your eyes
when i first beheld you  their expression and smile
did not  again he stopped did not  he proceeded hastily  strike delight to my very inmost
heart so for nothing people talk of natural sympathies  i have heard of good genii there are
grains of truth in the wildest fable my cherished
preserver good night  
strange energy was in his voice  strange fire in his
look
 i am glad i happened to be awake ” i said  and
then i was going
what  you will go  
252
jane eyre
 i am cold sir 
cold  yesand standing in a pool  go then
jane  go   but he still retained my hand and i
could not free it i bethought myself of an expedient
 i think i hear mrs fairfax move sir said i
66 well leave me   he relaxed his fingers and i
was gone
i regained my couch but never thought of sleep
till morning dawned i was tossed on a buoyant but
unquiet sea where billows of trouble rolled under
surges ofjoy i thought sometimes i saw beyond its
wild waters a shore sweet as the hills of beulah 
and now and then a refreshing gale wakened by
hope bore my spirit triumphantly towards the
bourne but i could not reach it even in fancya
counteracting breeze blew off land and continually
drove me back sense would resist delirium 
judgment would warn passion too feverish to rest
i rose as soon as day dawned
253
chapter xvi
i both wished and feared to see mr rochester on
the day which followed this sleepless night  i
wanted to hear his voice again yet feared to meet
his eye during the early part of the morning
i momentarily expected his coming  he was not in
the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom  but
he did step in for a few minutes sometimes
and i had the impression that he was sure to visit it
that day
but the morning passed just as usual  nothing
happened to interrupt the quiet course of adèles
studies  only soon after breakfast i heard some
bustle in the neighbourhood of mr rochesters
chamber mrs fairfaxs voice and leahs and the
cooks that is johns wifeand even johns own
gruff tones there were exclamations of what a
mercy master was not burnt in his bed    it is
always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night 
how providential that he had presence of mind to
think of the waterjug    i wonder he waked
nobody    it is to be hoped he will not take cold
with sleeping on the library sofa etc
to much confabulation succeeded a sound of
254
jane eyre
scrubbing and setting to rights  and when i passed
the room in going downstairs to dinner i saw
through the open door that all was again restored to
complete order  only the bed was stripped of its
hangings leah stood up in the window seat
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke i
was about to address her for i wished to know what
account had been given of the affair  but on
advancing i saw a second person in the chambera
woman sitting on a chair by the bedside and sewing
rings to new curtains that woman was no other
than grace poole
there she sat staid and taciturnlooking as usual
in her brown stuff gown her check apron white
handkerchief and cap she was intent on her work
in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed on
her hard forehead and in her commonplace features
was nothing either of the paleness or desperation
one would have expected to see marking the
countenance of a woman who had attempted
murder  and whose intended victim had followed
her last night to her lair and as i believed charged
her with the crime she wished to perpetrate i was
amazedconfounded she looked up while i still
gazed at her  no start no increase or failure of
colour betrayed emotion consciousness of guilt or
fear of detection she said  good morning miss
in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner  and
taking up another ring and more tape went on with
her sewing
255
jane eyre
i will put her to some test thought i   such
absolute impenetrability is past comprehension 
good morning grace i said has anything
happened here  i thought i heard the servants all
talking together a while ago 
66 only master had been reading in his bed last
night  he fell asleep with his candle lit and the
curtains got on fire  but fortunately he awoke
before the bed clothes or the woodwork caught and
contrived to quench the flame with the water in the
ewer 
a strange affair   i said in a low voice  then
looking at her fixedly did mr rochester wake
nobody  did no one hear him move
she again raised her eyes to me  and this time
there was something of consciousness in their
expression she seemed to examine me warily 
then she answered
the servants sleep so far off you know miss
they would not be likely to hear mrs fairfaxs
room and yours are the nearest to masters  but
mrs fairfax says she heard nothing  when people
get elderly they often sleep heavy she paused
and then added with a sort of assumed indifference
but still in a marked and significant tone but
you are young miss and i should say a light
sleeper  perhaps you may have heard a noise  
i did said i dropping my voice so that leah
who was still polishing the panes could not hear
me   and at first i thought it was pilot  but pilot
256
jane eyre
cannot laugh  and i am certain i heard a laugh
and a strange one 
she took a new needleful of thread waxed it
carefully threaded her needle with a steady hand
and then observed with perfect composure
 it is hardly likely master would laugh i should
think miss when he was in such danger  you must
have been dreaming 
i was not dreaming i said with some warmth
for her brazen coolness provoked me again she
looked at me and with the same scrutinizing and
conscious eye
have you told master that you heard a laugh  
she inquired
i have not had the opportunity of speaking to
him this morning
you did not think of opening your door and
looking out into the gallery   she further asked
she appeared to be cross questioning me 
attempting to draw from me information unawares
the idea struck me that if she discovered i knew or
suspected her guilt she would be playing off some of
her malignant pranks on me  i thought it advisable
to be on my guard
 on the contrary said i  i bolted my door 
then you are not in the habit of bolting your
door every night before you get into bed 
fiend  she wants to know my habits that she
may lay her plans accordingly   indignation again
prevailed over prudence  i replied sharply  hitherto
257 s
jane eyre
i have often omitted to fasten the bolt  i did not
think it necessary i was not aware any danger or
annoyance was to be dreaded at thornfield hall 
but in future  and i laid marked stress on the
words  i shall take good care to make all secure
before i venture to lie down 
it will be wise so to do was her answer 
 this neighbourhood is as quiet as any i know and
i never heard of the hall being attempted by
robbers since it was a house  though there are
hundreds of pounds worth of plate in the plate
closet as is well known and you see for such a
large house there are very few servants because
master has never lived here much  and when he
does come being a bachelor he needs little waiting
on  but i always think it best to err on the safe
side  a door is soon fastened and it is as well to
have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief
that may be about a deal of people miss are for
trusting all to providence  but i say providence
will not dispense with the means though he often
blesses them when they are used discreetly  and
here she closed her harangue a long one for her
and uttered with the demureness of a quakeress
i stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous self possession and
most inscrutable hypocrisy when the cook entered
mrs poole said she addressing grace  the
servants dinner will soon be ready will you come
down 
9
258
jane eyre
no  just put my pint of porter and bit of
pudding on a tray and ill carry it upstairs 
 youll have some meat  
just a morsel and a taste of cheese thats all 
and the sago 
never mind it at present  i shall be coming
down before teatime  ill make it myself 
the cook here turned to me saying that mrs
fairfax was waiting for me  so i departed
i hardly heard mrs fairfaxs account of the
curtain conflagration during dinner so much was i
occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
character of grace poole  and still more in pondering the problem of her position at thornfield  in
questioning why she had not been given into
custody that morning  or at the very least dismissed from her masters service he had almost
as much as declared his conviction of her criminality
last night what mysterious cause withheld him
from accusing her  why had he enjoined me too to
secrecy  it was strange  a bold vindictive and
haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power
of one of the meanest of his dependents  so much
in her power that even when she lifted her hand
against his life he dared not openly charge her
with the attempt much less punish her for it
had grace been young and handsome i should
have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings
than prudence or fear influenced mr rochester in
her behalf but hardfavoured and matronly as she
259
jane eyre
was the idea could not be admitted  yet i
reflected  she has been young once  her youth
would be contemporary with her masters  mrs
fairfax told me once she had lived here many
years i dont think she can ever have been pretty 
but for aught i know she may possess originality
and strength of character to compensate for the
want of personal advantages mr rochester is an
amateur of the decided and eccentric  grace is
eccentric at least what if a former caprice a
freak very possible to a nature so sudden and
headstrong as his has delivered him into her power
and she now exercises over his actions a secret
influence the result of his own indiscretion which
he cannot shake off and dare not disregard  ”
but having reached this point of conjecture mrs
pooles square flat figure and uncomely dry even
coarse face recurred so distinctly to my minds eye
that i thought  no  impossible  my supposition
cannot be correct yet suggested the secret
voice which talks to us in our own hearts you are
not beautiful either and perhaps mr rochester
approves you  at any rate you have often felt as if
he did  and last nightremember his words 
remember his look  remember his voice  
i
i well remembered all  language glance and
tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed
was now in the schoolroom  adèle was drawing  i
bent over her and directed her pencil she looked
up with a sort of start
260
jane eyre
quavezvous mademoiselle   said she vos
doigts tremblent comme la feuille et vos joues sont
rouges mais rouges comme des cerises  
 i am hot adèle with stooping   she went on
sketching i went on thinking
i hastened to drive from my mind the hateful
notion i had been conceiving respecting grace
poole it disgusted me i compared myself with
her and found we were different bessie leaven
had said i was quite a lady  and she spoke
truth i was a lady and now i looked much
better than i did when bessie saw me  i had more
colour and more flesh  more life more vivacity 
because i had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments
evening approaches said i as i looked towards
the window i have never heard mr rochesters
voice or step in the house today  but surely i shall
see him before night  i feared the meeting in
the morning  now i desire it because expectation has
been so long baffled that it is grown impatient 
when dusk actually closed and when adèle left
me to go and play in the nursery with sophie i
did most keenly desire it i listened for the
bell to ring below  i listened for leah coming
up with a message  i fancied sometimes i heard
mr rochesters own tread and i turned to the door
expecting it to open and admit him the door
remained shut  darkness only came in through the
window still it was not late  he often sent for me
261
jane eyre
at seven and eight oclock and it was yet but six
surely i should not be wholly disappointed to night
when i had so many things to say to him  i
wanted again to introduce the subject of grace
poole and to hear what he would answer  i wanted
to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she who
had made last nights hideous attempt  and if so why
he kept her wickedness a secret it little mattered
whether my curiosity irritated him  i knew the
pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns  it
was one i chiefly delighted in and a sure instinct
always prevented me from going too far beyond
the verge of provocation i never ventured  on the
extreme brink i liked well to try my skill retaining every minute form of respect every propriety of
my station i could still meet him in argument
without fear or uneasy restraint  this suited both
him and me
a tread creaked on the stairs at last  leah made
her appearance  but it was only to intimate that tea
was ready in mrs fairfaxs room thither i
repaired glad at least to go downstairs  for that
brought me i imagined nearer to mr rochesters
presence
you must want your tea said the good lady as
i joined her  you ate so little at dinner i am
afraid she continued  you are not well today 
you look flushed and feverish 
oh quite well  i never felt better
then you must prove it by evincing a good
1i1262
jane eyre
appetite  will you fill the teapot while i knit off this
needle  having completed her task she rose to
draw down the blind which she had hitherto kept
up  by way i suppose of making the most of daylight  though dusk was now fast deepening into
total obscurity
it is fair to night said she as she looked
through the panes though not starlight  mr
rochester has on the whole had a favourable day
for his journey
 journey  is mr rochester gone anywhere  i
did not know he was out 
oh he set off the moment he had breakfasted 
he is gone to the leas  mr eshtons place ten
miles on the other side millcote  i believe there is
quite a party assembled there  lord ingram sir
george lynn colonel dent and others
do you expect him back to night 
nonor tomorrow either  i should think he is
very likely to stay a week or more  when these fine
fashionable people get together they are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety  so well provided
with all that can please and entertain they are in no
hurry to separate gentlemen especially are often
in request on such occasions  and mr rochester is
so talented and so lively in society that i believe he
is a general favourite  the ladies are very fond of
him  though you would not think his appearance
calculated to recommend him particularly in their
eyes  but i suppose his acquirements and abilities
263
jane eyre
perhaps his wealth and good blood make amends for
any little fault of look 
are there ladies at the leas 
there are mrs eshton and her three daughters
very elegant young ladies indeed  and there are
the honourable blanche and mary ingram  most
beautiful women i suppose  indeed i have seen
blanche six or seven years since when she was a girl
of eighteen she came here to a christmas ball and
party mr rochester gave you should have seen the
diningroom that dayhow richly it was decorated
how brilliantly lit up  i should think there were fifty
ladies and gentlemen presentall of the first county
families  and miss ingram was considered the belle
of the evening 
you saw her you say mrs fairfax  what was
she like  
yes i saw her the diningroom doors were
thrown open  and as it was christmas time the
servants were allowed to assemble in the hall to
hear some of the ladies sing and play mr rochester
would have me to come in and i sat down in a quiet
corner and watched them i never saw a more
splendid scene  the ladies were magnificently
dressed  most of themat least most of the younger
oneslooked handsome  but miss ingram was certainly the queen 
and what was she like  
 tall fine bust sloping shoulders  long graceful
neck olive complexion dark and clear  noble
264
jane eyre
features  eyes rather like mr rochesters  large
and black and as brilliant as her jewels and then
she had such a fine head of hair  ravenblack and
so becomingly arranged  a crown of thick plaits
behind and in front the longest the glossiest curls
i ever saw she was dressed in pure white  an
amber coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder
and across her breast tied at the side and descending in long fringed ends below her knee she
wore an ambercoloured flower too in her hair  it
contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls
she was greatly admired of course  
66 yes indeed and not only for her beauty but
for her accomplishments she was one of the ladies
who sang a gentleman accompanied her on the
piano she and mr rochester sang a duet ”
mr rochester  i was not aware he could sing
oh he has a fine bass voice and an excellent
taste for music 
and miss ingram  what sort of a voice had
she  
a very rich and powerful one  she sang delightfully  it was a treat to listen to her  and she played
afterwards i am no judge of music but mr
rochester is  and i heard him say her execution was
remarkably good 
and this beautiful and accomplished lady is not
yet married  
it appears not  i fancy neither she nor her sister
have very large fortunes old lord ingrams estates
265
jane eyre
were chiefly entailed and the eldest son came in for
everything almost 
 but i wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman
has taken a fancy to her  mr rochester for instance
he is rich is he not 
oh yes but you see there is a considerable
difference in age  mr rochester is near forty  she
is but twentyfive
what ofthat  more unequal matches are made
every day 
 true  yet i should scarcely fancy mr rochester
would entertain an idea of the sort but you eat
nothing  you have scarcely tasted since you began
tea 
no  i am too thirsty to eat will you let me
have another cup  
i was about again to revert to the probability of a
union between mr rochester and the beautiful
blanche  but adèle came in and the conversation
was turned into another channel
when once more alone i reviewed the information
i had got looked into my heart examined its
thoughts and feelings and endeavoured to bring
back with a strict hand such as had been straying
through imaginations boundless and trackless waste
into the safe fold of common sense
arraigned at my own bar memory having given

how i had rejected the real and rabidly devoured

that a greater fool than jane eyre had never

idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies and
swallowed poison as if it were nectar
you i said  a favourite with mr rochester

importance to him in any way  go  your folly
sickens me and you have derived pleasure from
occasional tokens of preferenceequivocal tokens
shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the
world to a dependent and a novice how dared
you  poor stupid dupe  could not even selfinterest make you wiser  you repeated to yourself
this morning the brief scene
your face and be ashamed 
praise of your eyes did he 
their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
senselessness  it does good to no woman to be
flattered by her superior who cannot possibly intend
to marry her  and it is madness in all women to let
a secret love kindle within them which ifunreturned
and unknown must devour the life that feeds it 
and if discovered and responded to must lead ignisfatuuslike into miry wilds whence there is no
extrication

serious thought on this indigent and insignificant
plebeian 
268
jane eyre
 ill do it i resolved  and having framed this
determination i grew calm and fell asleep
i kept my word an hour or two sufficed to
sketch my own portrait in crayons  and in less than
a fortnight i had completed an ivory miniature of an
imaginary blanche ingram it looked a lovely face
enough and when compared with the real head in
chalk the contrast was as great as selfcontrol could
desire i derived benefit from the task  it had kept
my head and hands employed and had given force
and fixedness to the new impressions i wished to
stamp indelibly on my heart
ere long i had reason to congratulate myself on
the course of wholesome discipline to which i had
thus forced my feelings to submit  thanks to it i
was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a
decent calm which had they found me unprepared
i should probably have been unequal to maintain
even externally
269
chapter xvii
a week passed and no news arrived of mr
rochester  ten days and still he did not come
mrs fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
were to go straight from the leas to london and
thence to the continent and not show his face again
at thornfield for a year to come  he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and
unexpected when i heard this i was beginning to
feel a strange chill and failing at the heart i was
actually permitting myself to experience a sickening
sense of disappointment  but rallying my wits and
recollecting my principles i at once called my sensations to order and it was wonderful how i got over
the temporary blunderhow i cleared up the mistake
of supposing mr rochesters movements a matter in
which i had any cause to take a vital interest not
that i humbled myself by a slavish notion of
inferiority on the contrary i just said 
—
you have nothing to do with the master of
thornfield further than to receive the salary he gives
you for teaching his protégée and to be grateful for
such respectful and kind treatment as ifyou do your
270
jane eyre
duty you have a right to expect at his hands be
sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges
between you and him  so dont make him the object
of your fine feelings your raptures agonies and so
forth he is not of your order  keep to your caste 
and be too self respecting to lavish the love of the
whole heart soul and strength where such a gift is
not wanted and would be despised 
i went on with my days business tranquilly  but
ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering
across my brain of reasons why i should quit
thornfield  and i kept involuntarily framing
advertisements and pondering conjectures about
new situations  these thoughts i did not think it
necessary to check  they might germinate and bear
fruit if they could
mr rochester had been absent upwards of a
fortnight when the post brought mrs fairfax a
letter
it is from the master said she as she looked at
the direction now i suppose we shall know
whether we are to expect his return or not
and while she broke the seal and perused the
document i went on taking my coffee we were at
breakfast it was hot and i attributed to that
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my
face why my hand shook and why i involuntarily
spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer i
did not choose to consider
well i sometimes think we are too quiet  but
271
jane eyre
we run a chance of being busy enough now  for a
little while at least said mrs fairfax still holding
the note before her spectacles
ere i permitted myself to request an explanation i tied the string of adèles pinafore which
happened to be loose having helped her also to
another bun and refilled her mug with milk i said
nonchalantly 
mr rochester is not likely to return soon i
suppose 
indeed he isin three days he says  that will
be next thursday  and not alone either i dont
know how many of the fine people at the leas are
coming with him he sends directions for all the
best bedrooms to be prepared  and the library and
drawingrooms are to be cleaned out  and i am to
get more kitchen hands from the george inn at
millcote and from wherever else i can  and the
ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen
their valets  so we shall have a full house of it
and mrs fairfax swallowed her breakfast and
hastened away to commence operations
the three days were as she had foretold busy
enough i had thought all the rooms at thornfield
beautifully clean and well arranged  but it appears
i was mistaken three women were got to help 
and such scrubbing such brushing such washing of
paint and beating of carpets such taking down and
putting up of pictures such polishing of mirrors and
lustres such lighting of fires in bedrooms such
1272
jane eyre
airing of sheets and feather beds on hearths i
never beheld either before or since adèle ran
quite wild in the midst of it  the preparations for
company and the prospect of their arrival seemed
to throw her into ecstasies she would have sophie
to look over all her  toilettes  as she called frocks 
to furbish up any that were passées and to air
and arrange the new for herself she did nothing
but caper about in the front chambers jump on and
off the bedsteads and lie on the mattresses and
piled up bolsters and pillows before the enormous
fires roaring in the chimneys from school duties
she was exonerated  mrs fairfax had pressed me
into her service and i was all day in the storeroom
helping or hindering her and the cook  learning
to make custards and cheesecakes and french
pastry to truss game and garnish dessertdishes
the party were expected to arrive on thursday
afternoon in time for dinner at six during the
intervening period i had no time to nurse chimeras 
and i believe i was as active and gay as anybodyadèle excepted still now and then i received a
damping check to my cheerfulness  and was in
spite of myself thrown back on the region of doubts
and portents and dark conjectures this was when
i chanced to see the third storey staircase door
which of late had always been kept locked open
slowly and give passage to the form of grace poole
in prim cap white apron and handkerchief  when i
watched her glide along the gallery her quiet tread
273 t
jane eyre
muffled in a list slipper  when i saw her look into
the bustling topsy turvy bedroomsjust say a word
perhaps to the charwoman about the proper way to
polish a grate or clean a marble mantelpiece or
take stains from papered walls and then pass on
she would thus descend to the kitchen once a day
eat her dinner smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth
and go back carrying her pot of porter with her for
her private solace in her own gloomy upper haunt
only one hour in the twentyfour did she pass with
her fellow servants below  all the rest of her time
was spent in some lowceiled oaken chamber of the
second storey there she sat and sewedand probably laughed drearily to herself as companionless
as a prisoner in his dungeon
the strangest thing of all was that not a soul
in the house except me noticed her habits or
seemed to marvel at them  no one discussed her
position or employment  no one pitied her solitude
or isolation i once indeed overheard part of a
dialogue between leah and one of the charwomen
of which grace formed the subject leah had been
saying something i had not caught and the charwoman remarked —
 she gets good wages i guess  
66 yes said leah   i wish i had as good  not
that mine are to complain of theres no stinginess
at thornfield  but theyre not onefifth of the sum
mrs poole receives and she is laying by  she goes
every quarter to the bank at millcote i should not
274
jane eyre
wonder but she has saved enough to keep her
independent if she liked to leave  but i suppose
shes got used to the place  and then shes not forty
yet and strong and able for anything it is too
soon for her to give up business
she is a good hand i dare say said the charwoman
ahshe understands what she has to donobody better rejoined leah significantly   and it
is not every one who could fill her shoes  not for all
the money she gets
that it is not   was the reply  i wonder
whether master
the charwoman was going on  but here leah
turned and perceived me and she instantly gave her
companion a nudge
doesnt she know  i heard the woman whisper
leah shook her head and the conversation was
of course dropped all i had gathered from it
amounted to thisthat there was a mystery at
thornfield  and that from participation in that
mystery i was purposely excluded
thursday came  all work had been completed the
previous evening  carpets were laid down bedhangings festooned radiant white counterpanes
spread toilet tables arranged furniture rubbed
flowers piled in vases  both chambers and saloons
looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
them the hall too was scoured  and the great
carved clock as well as the steps and banisters of the
275
jane eyre
staircase were polished to the brightness of glass 
in the diningroom the sideboard flashed resplendent
with plate  in the drawingroom and boudoir vases
of exotics bloomed on all sides
afternoon arrived  mrs fairfax assumed her best
black satin gown her gloves and her gold watch 
for it was her part to receive the company to conduct the ladies to their rooms etc adèle too
would be dressed  though i thought she had little
chance of being introduced to the party that day at
least however to please her i allowed sophie to
apparel her in one of her short full muslin frocks
for myself i had no need to make any change  i
should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the
schoolroom  for a sanctum it was now become to
me a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble

it had been a mild serene spring day one of
those days which towards the end of march or the
beginning of april rise shining over the earth as
heralds of summer it was drawing to an end now 
but the evening was even warm and i sat at work in
the schoolroom with the window open
 it gets late said mrs fairfax entering in rustling state  i am glad i ordered dinner an hour
after the time mr rochester mentioned  for it
is past six now i have sent john down to the gates
to see if there is anything on the road  one can see
a long way from thence in the direction of millcote
she went to the window here he is   said she
well john  leaning out  any news  
276
jane eyre
66 
was the answer
 theyre coming maam was
theyll be here in ten minutes
adèle flew to the window i followed  taking
care to stand on one side so that screened by the
curtain i could see without being seen
the ten minutes john had given seemed very long
but at last wheels were heard  four equestrians
galloped up the drive and after them came two open
carriages fluttering veils and waving plumes filled
the vehicles  two of the cavaliers were young
dashing looking gentlemen  the third was mr
rochester on his black horse mesrour  pilot
bounding before him  at his side rode a lady and he
and she were the first of the party her purple
ridinghabit almost swept the ground her veil
streamed long on the breeze  mingling with its
transparent folds and gleaming through them shone
rich raven ringlets
miss ingram   exclaimed mrs fairfax and away
she hurried to her post below
the cavalcade following the sweep of the drive
quickly turned the angle of the house and i lost
sight of it adèle now petitioned to go down  but i
took her on my knee and gave her to understand
that she must not on any account think of venturing
in sight of the ladies either nowor at any other time
unless expressly sent for  that mr rochester would
be very angry etc some natural tears she shed
on being told this  but as i began to look very grave
she consented at last to wipe them
277
jane eyre
a joyous stir was now audible in the hall  gentlemens deep tones and ladies silvery accents blent
harmoniously together and distinguishable above
all though not loud was the sonorous voice of the
master of thornfield hall welcoming his fair and
gallant guests under its roof then light steps ascended the stairs  and there was a tripping through
the gallery and soft cheerful laughs and opening
and closing doors and for a time a hush
elles changent de toilettes said adèle  who
listening attentively had followed every movement 
and she sighed
chez maman said she  quand il y avait du
monde je le suivais partout au salon et à leurs
chambres  souvent je regardais les femmes de
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames et cétait si
amusant  comme cela on apprend 
dont you feel hungry adèle  
mais oui mademoiselle  violà cinq ou six heures
que nous navons pas mangé 

well now while the ladies are in their rooms i
will venture down and get you something to eat
and issuing from my asylum with precaution i
sought a backstairs which conducted directly to the
kitchen all in that region was fire and commotion 
the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection
and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of
mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion
in the servants hall two coachmen and three gentlemens gentlemen stood or sat round the fire  the
278
jane eyre
abigails i suppose were upstairs with their
mistresses  the new servants that had been hired
from millcote were bustling about everywhere
threading this chaos i at last reached the larder 
there i took possession of a cold chicken a roll of
bread some tarts a plate or two and a knife
and fork  with this booty i made a hasty retreat i
had regained the gallery and was just shutting the
back door behind me when an accelerated hum
warned me that the ladies were about to issue
from their chambers i could not proceed to the
schoolroom without passing some of their doors
and running the risk of being surprised with
my cargo of victualage  so i stood still at this
end which being windowless was dark  quite
dark now for the sun was set and twilight gathering
presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants
one after another  each came out gaily and airily
with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk
for a moment they stood grouped together at the
other extremity of the gallery conversing in a key of
sweet subdued vivacity  they then descended the
staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls
down a hill their collective appearance had left
on me an impression of highborn elegance such as
i had never before received
i found adèle peeping through the schoolroom
door which she held ajar
cried she in english
what beautiful ladies  
 oh i wish i might go to
279
jane eyre
them  do you think mr rochester will send for us
byandby after dinner  
no indeed i dont  mr rochester has something else to think about never mind the ladies
tonight  perhaps you will see them tomorrow here
is your dinner 
she was really hungry so the chicken and tarts
served to divert her attention for a time it was
well i secured this forage  or both she i and sophie
to whom i conveyed a share of our repast would
have run a chance of getting no dinner at all  every
one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us
the dessert was not carried out till after nine  and
at ten footmen were still running to and fro with
trays and coffee cups i allowed adèle to sit up
much later than usual  for she declared she could
not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening
and shutting below and people bustling about
besides she added a message might possibly come
from mr rochester when she was undressed   et
alors quel dommage  
i told her stories as long as she would listen to
them  and then for a change i took her out into the
gallery the hall lamp was now lit and it amused
her to look over the balustrade and watch the
servants passing backwards and forwards when
the evening was far advanced a sound of music
issued from the drawingroom whither the piano
had been removed  adèle and i sat down on the top
step of the stairs to listen presently a voice blent
280
jane eyre
with the rich tones of the instrument  it was a lady
who sang and very sweet her notes were the solo
over a duet followed and then a glee  a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals i listened
long  suddenly i discovered that my ear was wholly
intent on analyzing the mingled sounds and trying
to discriminate amidst the confusion ofaccents those
of mr rochester  and when it caught them which
it soon did it found a further task in framing the
tones rendered by distance inarticulate into words
the clock struck eleven i looked at adèle
whose head leant against my shoulder  her eyes were
waxing heavy so i took her up in my arms and
carried her off to bed it was near one before the
gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers
miss
the next day was as fine as its predecessor  it was
devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in
the neighbourhood they set out early in the forenoon some on horseback the rest in carriages  i
witnessed both the departure and the return
ingram as before was the only lady equestrian  and
as before mr rochester galloped at her side  the
two rode a little apart from the rest i pointed out
this circumstance to mrs fairfax who was standing
at the window with me
you said it was not likely they should think of
being married said i  but you see mr rochester
evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies 
yes i dare say  no doubt he admires her
and she him i added   look how she leans
281
jane eyre
her head towards him as if she were conversing confidentially  i wish i could see her face  i have never
had a glimpse of it yet
you will see her this evening answered mrs
fairfax  i happened to remark to mr rochester
how much adèle wished to be introduced to the
ladies and he said   oh  let her come into the
drawingroom after dinner  and request miss eyre
to accompany her 
yeshe said that from mere politeness  i need
not go i am sure i answered
well i observed to him that as you were unused
to company i did not think you would like appearing
before so gay a partyall strangers and he replied
in his quick way   nonsense  if she objects tell
her it is my particular wish  and if she resists say i
shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy 
 i will not give him that trouble i answered
 i will go if no better may be but i dont like it
shall you be there mrs fairfax  
 no  i pleaded off and he admitted my plea
ill tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance which is
the most disagreeable part of the business you
must go into the drawingroom while it is empty
before the ladies leave the dinnertable  choose your
seat in any quiet nook you like  you need not stay
long after the gentlemen come in unless you please 
just let mr rochester see you are there and then
slip awaynobody will notice you 
282
jane eyre
will these people remain long do you think 
perhaps two or three weeks  certainly not more
after the easter recess sir george lynn who was
lately elected member for millcote will have to go
up to town and take his seat  i dare say mr
rochester will accompany him  it surprises me that
he has already made so protracted a stay at thornfield 
it was with some trepidation that i perceived the
hour approach when i was to repair with my charge
to the drawingroom adèle had been in a state of
ecstasy all day after hearing she was to be presented
to the ladies in the evening  and it was not till
sophie commenced the operation of dressing her
that she sobered down then the importance ofthe
process quickly steadied her  and by the time she
had her curls arranged in well smoothed drooping
clusters her pink satin frock put on her long sash
tied and her lace mittens adjusted she looked as
grave as any judge no need to warn her not to
disarrange her attire  when she was dressed she sat
demurely down in her little chair taking care
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she
should crease it and assured me she would not stir
thence till i was ready this i quickly was  my
best dress the silver grey one purchased for miss
temples wedding and never worn since was soon
put on  my hair was soon smoothed  my sole
ornament the pearl brooch soon assumed we
descended
283
jane eyre
fortunately there was another entrance to the
drawing room than that through the saloon where
they were all seated at dinner wefound the apartment vacant  a large fire burning silently on the
marble hearth and wax candles shining in bright
solitude amid the exquisite flowers with which the
tables were adorned the crimson curtain hung
before the arch  slight as was the separation this
drapery formed from the party in the adjoining
saloon they spoke in so low a key that nothing of
their conversation could be distinguished beyond a
soothing murmur
adèle who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnizing impression sat down
without a word on the footstool i pointed out to
her i retired to a window seat and taking a book
from the table near endeavoured to read adèle
brought her stool to my feet  ere long she touched
my knee
what is it adèle  
 est ce que je ne puis prendre une seule de ces
fleurs magnifiques mademoiselle  seulement pour
completer ma toilette 
you think too much of your  toilette adèle 
but you may have a flower and i took a rose from
a vase and fastened it in her sash she sighed a
sigh of ineffable satisfaction as if her cup of
happiness were now full i turned my face away to
conceal a smile i could not suppress  there was
something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
284
jane eyre
parisiennes earnest and innate devotion to matters
of dress
a soft sound of rising now became audible  the
curtain was swept back from the arch  through it
appeared the diningroom with its lit lustre pouring
down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
dessert service covering a long table a band of
ladies stood in the opening  they entered and the
curtain fell behind them
there were but eight  yet somehow as they
flocked in they gave the impression of a much
larger number some of them were very tall  many
were dressed in white  and all had a sweeping
amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon i rose and
curtsied to them  one or two bent their heads in
return the others only stared at me
they dispersed about the room reminding me by
the lightness and buoyancy of their movements of a
flock of white plumy birds some of them threw
themselves in half reclining positions on the sofas
and ottomans  some bent over the tables and
examined the flowers and books  the rest gathered
in a group round the fire  all talked in a low but
clear tone which seemed habitual to them i knew
their names afterwards and may as well mention
them now
first there was mrs eshton and two of her
daughters she had evidently been a handsome
woman and was well preserved still of her
285
jane eyre
daughters the eldest amy was rather little  naïve
and childlike in face and manner and piquant in
form her white muslin dress and blue sash became
her well the second louisa was taller and more
elegant in figure  with a very pretty face of that
order the french term minois chiffoné   both
sisters were fair as lilies
lady lynn was a large and stout personage of
about forty  very erect very haughtylooking richly
dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen  her dark
hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure
plume and within the circlet of a band of gems
mrs colonel dent was less showy  but i thought
more ladylike she had a slight figure a pale
gentle face and fair hair her black satin dress
her scarf ofrich foreign lace and her pearl ornaments
pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the
titled dame
but the three most distinguished—partly perhaps
because the tallest figures of the bandwere the
dowager lady ingram and her daughters blanche
and mary they were all three of the loftiest stature
of woman the dowager might be between forty
and fifty her shape was still fine  her hair by
candlelight at least still black  her teeth too were
still apparently perfect most people would have
termed her a splendid woman of her age and so
she was no doubt physically speaking  but then
there was an expression of almost insupportable
haughtiness in her bearing and countenance she
286
jane eyre
had roman features and a double chin disappearing
into a throat like a pillar  these features appeared
to me not only inflated and darkened but even
furrowed with pride  and the chin was sustained by
the same principle in a position of almost preternatural erectness she had likewise a fierce and a
hard eye it reminded me of mrs reeds  she
mouthed her words in speaking  her voice was deep
its inflections very pompous very dogmatical—very
intolerable in short a crimson velvet robe and a
shawlturban of some gold wrought indian fabric
invested her i suppose she thought with a truly
imperial dignity
blanche and mary were of equal staturestraight
and tall as poplars mary was too slim for her
height  but blanche was moulded like a dian i
regarded her of course with especial interest
first i wished to see whether her appearance
accorded with mrs fairfaxs description  secondly
whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature i had
painted of her  and thirdly it will out whether
it were such as i should fancy likely to suit mr
rochesters taste
as far as person went she answered point for
point both to my picture and mrs fairfaxs
description the noble bust the sloping shoulders
the graceful neck the dark eyes and black ringlets
were all there but her face  her face was like
her mothers  a youthful unfurrowed likeness  the
same low brow the same high features the same
287
jane eyre
pride it was not however so saturnine a pride 
she laughed continually  her laugh was satirical
and so was the habitual expression of her arched
and haughty lip
genius is said to be self conscious  i cannot tell
whether miss ingram was a genius but she was
self conscious remarkably self conscious indeed
she entered into a discourse on botany with the
gentle mrs dent it seems mrs dent had not
studied that science  though as she said she liked
flowers  especially wild ones   miss ingram had
and she ran over its vocabulary with an air i
presently perceived she was what is vernacularly
termed trailing mrs dent  that is playing on her
ignorance  her trail might be clever but it was
decidedly not goodnatured she played  her
execution was brilliant  she sang  her voice was
fine  she talked french apart to her mamma  and
she talked it well with fluency and with a good
accent
mary had a milder and more open countenance
than blanche  softer features too and a skin some
shades fairer miss ingram was dark as a spaniard
but mary was deficient in life her face lacked
expression her eye lustre  she had nothing to say
and having once taken her seat remained fixed like
a statue in its niche the sisters were both attired
in spotless white
and did i now think miss ingram such a choice
as mr rochester would be likely to make  i could
288
jane eyre

not tell i did not know his taste in female beauty
if he liked the majestic she was the very type of
majesty then she was accomplished sprightly
most gentlemen would admire her i thought  and
that he did admire her i already seemed to have
obtained proof  to remove the last shade of doubt
it remained but to see them together
you are not to suppose reader that adèle has all
this time been sitting motionless on the stool at
my feet  no  when the ladies entered she rose
advanced to meet them made a stately reverence
and said with gravity
bon jour mesdames 
and miss ingram had looked down at her with a
mocking air and exclaimed  oh what a little
puppet  
lady lynn had remarked  it is mr rochesters
ward i suppose the little french girl he was
speaking of 
mrs dent had kindly taken her hand and given
her a kiss amy and louisa eshton had cried out
simultaneously—
what a love of a child  
and then they had called her to a sofa where she
now sat ensconced between them chattering alternately in french and broken english absorbing not
only the young ladies attention but that of mrs
eshton and lady lynn and getting spoilt to her
hearts content
at last coffee is brought in and the gentlemen
289 u
jane eyre
are summoned i sit in the shadeif any shade
there be in this brilliantlylit apartment  the
windowcurtain half hides me again the arch
yawns they come the collective appearance of
the gentlemen like that of the ladies is very
imposing they are all costumed in black  most of
them are tall some young henry and frederick
lynn are very dashing sparks indeed  and colonel
dent is a fine soldierly man mr eshton the
magistrate of the district is gentleman like  his
hair is quite white his eyebrows and whiskers still
dark which gives him something of the appearance
of a  père noble de théâtre lord ingram like
his sisters is very tall  like them also he is handsome  but he shares marys apathetic and listless
look  he seems to have more length of limb than
vivacity of blood or vigour of brain
and where is mr rochester 
he comes in last  i am not looking at the arch
yet i see him enter i try to concentrate my
attention on those nettingneedles on the meshes
of the purse i am formingi wish to think only of
the work i have in my hands to see only the silver
beads and silk threads that lie in my lap  whereas
i distinctly behold his figure and i inevitably recall
the moment when i last saw it  just after i had
rendered him what he deemed an essential service
and he holding my hand and looking down on
my face surveyed me with eyes that revealed a
heart full and eager to overflow  in whose emotions
290
jane eyre
i had a part how near had i approached him at
that moment  what had occurred since calculated
to change his and my relative positions  yet now
how distant how far estranged we were  so far
estranged that i did not expect him to come and
speak to me i did not wonder when without
looking at me he took a seat at the other side of
the room and began conversing with some of the
ladies
no sooner did i see that his attention was riveted
on them and that i might gaze without being
observed than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to
his face i could not keep their lids under control 
they would rise and the irids would fix on him i
looked and had an acute pleasure in looking—a
precious yet poignant pleasure  pure gold with a
steely point of agony  a pleasure like what the
thirstperishing man might feel who knows the well
to which he has crept is poisoned yet stoops and
drinks divine draughts nevertheless
most true is it that  beauty is in the eye of the
gazer my masters colourless olive face square
massive brow broad and jetty eyebrows deep eyes
strong features firm grim mouth all energy decision will were not beautiful according to rule 
but they were more than beautiful to me  they were
full of an interest an influence that quite mastered
me that took my feelings from my own power and
fettered them in his i had not intended to love
him the reader knows that i had wrought hard to
291
jane eyre
extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected  and now at the first renewed view of him
they spontaneously revived green and strong  he
made me love him without looking at me
i compared him with his guests what was the
gallant grace of the lynns the languid elegance of
lord ingram even the military distinction of
colonel dent contrasted with his look of native pith
and genuine power  i had no sympathy in their
appearance their expression  yet i could imagine
that most observers would call them attractive  handsome imposing  while they would pronounce mr
rochester at once harshfeatured and melancholylooking i saw them smile laughit was nothing 
the light of the candles had as much soul in it as
their smile the tinkle of the bell as much significance
as their laugh i sawmr rochester smile his stern
features softened  his eye grew both brilliant and
gentle its ray both searching and sweet he was
talking at the moment to louisa and amy eshton
i wondered to see them receive with calm that look
which seemed to me so penetrating  i expected their
eyes to fall their colour to rise under it  yet i was
glad when i found they were in no sense moved
 he is not to them what he is to me i thought
 he is not oftheir kind i believe he is of mine i
am sure he is i feel akin to him i understand the
language of his countenance and movements  though
rank and wealth sever us widely i have something in
my brain and heart in my blood and nerves that
292
jane eyre
assimilates me mentally to him did i say a few
days since that i had nothing to do with him but to
receive my salary at his hands  did i forbid myself
to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster  blasphemy against nature  every good
true vigorous feeling i have gathers impulsively
round him i know i must conceal my sentiments 
i must smother hope  i must remember that he
cannot care much for me for when i say that i am
of his kind i do not mean that i have his force
to influence and his spell to attract  i mean only
that i have certain tastes and feelings in common
with him i must then repeat continually that we
are for ever sundered  —and yet while i breathe and
think i must love him 
coffee is handed the ladies since the gentlemen
entered have become lively as larks  conversation
waxes brisk and merry colonel dent and mr
eshton argue on politics  their wives listen the
two proud dowagers lady lynn and lady ingram
confabulate together sir georgewhom bythebye i have forgotten to describe a very big and
very freshlooking country gentleman stands before
their sofa coffee cup in hand and occasionally
puts in a word mr frederick lynn has taken
a seat beside mary ingram and is showing her the
engravings of a splendid volume  she looks smiles
now and then but apparently says little the tall
and phlegmatic lord ingram leans with folded arms
on the chair back of the little and lively amy eshton 
293
jane eyre
she glances up at him and chatters like a wren  she
likes him better than she does mr rochester
henry lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at
the feet of louisa  adèle shares it with him he is
trying to talk french with her and louisa laughs at
his blunders with whom will blanche ingram pair 
she is standing alone at the table bending gracefully over an album she seems waiting to be sought
but she will not wait too long  she herself selects a
mate
mr rochester having quitted the eshtons stands
on the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table 
she confronts him taking her station on the opposite
side of the mantelpiece
mr rochester i thought you were not fond of
children 
 nor am i
then what induced you to take charge of such a
little doll as that   pointing to adèle  where
did you pick her up 
i did not pick her up  she was left on my hands ”
you should have sent her to school 
 i could not afford it  schools are so dear 
why i suppose you have a governess for her  i
saw a person with her just nowis she gone  oh
no  there she is still behind the window curtain
you pay her of course  i should think it quite as
expensive more so  for you have them both to keep
in addition 
i feared or should i say hoped  the allusion
294
jane eyre
to me would make mr rochester glance my way 
and i involuntarily shrank further into the shade 
but he never turned his eyes
 i have not considered the subject said he
indifferently looking straight before him
common sense
no you men never do consider economy and
you should hear mamma on the
chapter of governesses mary and i have had i
should think a dozen at least in our day  half of
them detestable and the rest ridiculous and all
incubiwere they not mamma  ”
did you speak my own
the young lady thus claimed as the dowagers
special property reiterated her question with an
explanation
my dearest dont mention governesses  the
word makes me nervous i have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice i thank
heaven i have now done with them  
mrs dent here bent over to the pious lady and
whispered something in her ear  i suppose from the
answer elicited it was a reminder that one of the
anathematized race was present
tant pis   said her ladyship  i hope it may do
her good   then in a lower tone but still loud
enough for meto hear  i noticed her  i am a judge
of physiognomy and in hers i see all the faults of
her class 
what are they madam   inquired mr rochester
aloud
295
jane eyre
i will tell you in your private ear replied she
wagging her turban three times with portentous
significancy
but my curiosity will be past its appetite  it
craves food now
 ask blanche  she is nearer you than i
oh dont refer him to me mamma  i have just
one word to say of the whole tribe  they are a
nuisance not that i ever suffered much from them 
i took care to turn the tables what tricks
theodore and i used to play on our miss wilsons
and mrs greys and madame jouberts  mary was
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit the
best fun was with madame joubert  miss wilson
was a poor sickly thing lachrymose and lowspirited 
not worth the trouble of vanquishing in short  and
mrs grey was coarse and insensible  no blow took
effect on her but poor madame joubert  i see
her yet in her raging passions when we had driven
her to extremitiesspilt our tea crumbled our
bread and butter tossed our books up to the ceiling
and played a charivari with the ruler and desk
the fender and fire irons theodore do you
remember those merry days  
yaas to be sure i do drawled lord ingram 
and the poor old stick used to cry out  oh you
villains childs   and then we sermonized her on the
presumption of attempting to teach such clever
blades as we were when she was herself so ignorant 
we did  and tedo you know i helped you in
296
jane eyre
prosecuting or persecuting your tutor whey faced
mr vining the parson in the pip as we used to
call him he and miss wilson took the liberty of
falling in love with each otherat least tedo and i
thought so  we surprised sundry tender glances and
sighs which we interpreted as tokens of  la belle
passion and i promise you the public soon had the
benefit of our discovery  we employed it as a sort
of lever to hoist our deadweights from the house
dear mamma there as soon as she got an inkling of
the business found out that it was of an immoral
tendency did you not my lady mother 
certainly my best and i was quite right 
depend on that  there are a thousand reasons why
liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
be tolerated a moment in any well regulated house 
firstly
 oh gracious mamma  spare us the enumeration  au reste we all know them  danger of bad
example to innocence of childhood  distractions and
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the
attachedmutual alliance and reliance  confidence
thence resulting insolence accompanyingmutiny
and general blowup am i right baroness ingram
of ingram park 
 my lilyflower you are right now as always 
then no more need be said  change the
subject 
amy eshton not hearing or not heeding this
dictum joined in with her soft infantine tone 
297
jane eyre
 louisa and i used to quiz our governess too  but
she was such a good creature she would bear anything  nothing put her out she was never cross
with us  was she louisa  
 no never  we might do what we pleased 
ransack her desk and her workbox and turn her
drawers inside out  and she was so goodnatured
she would give us anything we asked for ”
i suppose now said miss ingram curling her
lip sarcastically we shall have an abstract of the
memoirs of all the governesses extant  in order to
avert such a visitation i again move the introduction
of a new topic mr rochester do you second my
motion  
madam i support you on this point as on every
other 
then on me be the onus of bringing it forward
signor eduardo are you in voice to night  
donna bianca if you command it i will be
then signor i lay on you my sovereign behest
to furbish up your lungs and other vocal organs as
they will be wanted on my royal service 
who would not be the rizzio of so divine a
mary
 a fig for rizzio   cried she tossing her head
with all its curls as she moved to the piano it is
my opinion the fiddler david must have been an
insipid sort of fellow  i like black bothwell better
to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the
devil in him  and history may say what it will of
298
jane eyre
ร
james hepburn but i have a notion he was just the
sort of wild fierce bandit hero whom i could have
consented to gift with my hand 
gentlemen you hear  now which of you most
resembles bothwell   cried mr rochester
 i should say the preference lies with you
responded colonel dent
on my honour i am much obliged to you was
the reply
miss ingram who had now seated herself with
proud grace at the piano spreading out her snowy
robes in queenly amplitude commenced a brilliant
prelude  talking meantime she appeared to be on
her high horse to night  both her words and her air
seemed intended to excite not only the admiration
but the amazement ofher auditors  she was evidently
bent on striking them as something very dashing
and daring indeed
 oh i am so sick of the young men of the
present day   exclaimed she rattling away at the
instrument poor puny things not fit to stir a
step beyond papas parkgates  nor to go even so
far without mammas permission and guardianship 
creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty
faces and their white hands and their small feet  as
if a man had anything to do with beauty  as if
loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman
her legitimate appanage and heritage  i grant
an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of creation 
but as to the gentlemen let them be solicitous to
299
jane eyre
possess only strength and valour  let their motto
be hunt shoot and fight  the rest is not worth a
fillip  such should be my device were i a man ”
whenever i marry she continued after a pause
which none interrupted  i am resolved my husband
shall not be a rival but a foil to me i will suffer
no competitor near the throne  i shall exact an
undivided homage  his devotions shall not be
shared between me and the shape he sees in his
mirror mr rochester now sing and i will play for
you
i am all obedience was the response
here then is a corsair song know that i dote
on corsairs  and for that reason sing it  con
spirito 
commands from miss ingrams lips would put
spirit into a mug of milk andwater 
take care then if you dont please me i will
shame you by showing how such things should be
done
that is offering a premium on incapacity  i
shall now endeavour to fail 
gardezvous en bien  if you err wilfully i
shall devise a proportionate punishment
miss ingram ought to be clement for she has it
in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal
endurance
ha  explain   commanded the lady
pardon me madam  no need of explanation 
your own fine sense must inform you that one of
300
jane eyre
your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
capital punishment 
sing   said she and again touching the piano
she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style
now is my time to slip away thought i  but
the tones that then severed the air arrested me
mrs fairfax had said mr rochester possessed a fine
voice  he did a mellow powerful bass into which
he threw his own feeling his own force  finding a
way through the ear to the heart and there waking
sensation strangely i waited till the last deep and
full vibration had expiredtill the tide of talk
checked an instant had resumed its flow  i then
quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
the side door which was fortunately near thence
a narrow passage led into the hall  in crossing it
i perceived my sandal was loose  i stopped to tie it
kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the
foot of the staircase i heard the diningroom door
unclose  a gentleman came out  rising hastily i
stood face to face with him it was mr rochester
how do you do   he asked
 i am very well sir 

why did you not come and speak to me in the
room 
i thought i might have retorted the question on
him who put it but i would not take that freedom
i answered 
i did not wish to disturb you as you seemed
engaged sir 
301
jane eyre
what have you been doing during my
absence  
nothing particular  teaching adèle as usual ”
 and getting a good deal paler than you were—
as i saw at first sight what is the matter  
nothing at all sir ”
 did you take any cold that night you half
drowned me 
not the least 
return to the drawingroom  you are deserting
too early
i am tired sir 
he looked at me for a minute
and a little depressed he said
tell me
what about
nothingnothing sir i am not depressed ”
“ but i affirm that you are so much depressed
that a few more words would bring tears to your
eyes indeed they are there now shining and
swimming  and a bead has slipped from the lash
and fallen on to the flag if i had time and was
not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
servant passing i would know what all this means
well tonight i excuse you  but understand that so
long as my visitors stay i expect you to appear in
the drawingroom every evening it is my wish 
dont neglect it now go and send sophie for
adèle good night my he stopped bit his
lip and abruptly left me
302
chapter xviii
merry days were these at thornfield hall and busy
days too how different from the first three months
of stillness monotony and solitude i had passed
beneath its roof  all sad feelings seemed now
driven from the house all gloomy associations forgotten there was life everywhere movement all day
long you could not now traverse the gallery once
so hushed nor enter the front chambers once so
tenantless without encountering a smart ladysmaid or a dandy valet
the kitchen the butlers pantry the servants
hall were equally alive  and the saloons were only
left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon
sunshine of the genial spring weather called their
occupants out into the grounds even when that
weather was broken and continuous rain set in for
some days no damp seemed cast over enjoyment 
indoor amusements only became more lively and
varied in consequence of the stop put to outdoor
gaiety
i wondered what they were going to do the first
evening a change of entertainment was proposed 
303
jane eyre
mrs
they spoke of  playing charades but in my
ignorance i did not understand the term the
servants were called in the diningroom tables
wheeled away the lights otherwise disposed the
chairs placed in a semi circle opposite the arch
while mr rochester and the other gentlemen
directed these alterations the ladies were running
up and downstairs ringing for their maids
fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls dresses
draperies of any kind  and certain wardrobes of the
third storey were ransacked and their contents in
the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats satin
sacques black modes lace lappets etc  were brought
down in armfuls by the abigails  then a selection
was made and such things as were chosen were
carried to the boudoir within the drawingroom
meantime mr rochester had again summoned the
ladies round him and was selecting certain of their
number to be of his party  miss ingram is mine
of course said he afterwards he named the two
misses eshton and mrs dent he looked at me  i
happened to be near him as i had been fastening
the clasp of mrs dents bracelet which had got
loose
will you play   he asked ii shook my head
he did not insist which i rather feared he would
have done he allowed me to return quietly to my
usual seat
he and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain 
304
jane eyre
the other party which was headed by colonel dent
sat down on the crescent of chairs one of the
gentlemen mr eshton observing me seemed to
propose that i should be asked to join them but
lady ingram instantly negatived the notion
no i heard her say   she looks too stupid for
any game of the sort 
ere long a bell tinkled and the curtain drew up
within the arch the bulky figure of sir george lynn
whom mr rochester had likewise chosen was seen
enveloped in a white sheet  before him on a table
lay open a large book  and at his side stood amy
eshton draped in mr rochesters cloak and holding
a book in her hand somebody unseen rang the
bell merrily  then adèle who had insisted on being
one of her guardians party bounded forward scattering round her the contents of a basket of flowers
she carried on her arm then appeared the magnificent figure of miss ingram clad in white a long
veil on her head and a wreath of roses round her
brow by her side walked mr rochester and
together they drew near the table they knelt while
mrs dent and louisa eshton dressed also in white
took up their stations behind them a ceremony
followed in dumb show in which it was easy to
recognize the pantomime of a marriage at its
termination colonel dent and his party consulted in
whispers for two minutes then the colonel called
out bride   mr rochester bowed and the curtain
fell
305 x
jane eyre
rose
a considerable interval elapsed before it again
its second rising displayed a more elaborately
prepared scene than the last the drawing room
as i have before observed was raised two steps above
the dining room and on the top ofthe upper step
placed a yard or two back within the room appeared
a large marble basin which i recognized as an
ornament of the conservatorywhere it usually
stood surrounded by exotics and tenanted by goldfishand whence it must have been transported with
some trouble on account of its size and weight
seated on the carpet by the side of this basin was
seen mr rochester costumed in shawls with a
turban on his head his dark eyes and swarth skin
and paynim features suited the costume exactly  he
looked the very model of an eastern emir  an agent
or a victim of the bowstring presently advanced
into view miss ingram she too was attired in
oriental fashion  a crimson scarf tied sashlike round
the waist  an embroidered handkerchief knotted
about her temples  her beautifully moulded arms
bare one of them upraised in the act of supporting
a pitcher poised gracefully on her head both her
cast of form and feature her complexion and her
general air suggested the idea of some israelitish
princess of the patriarchal days  and such was
doubtless the character she intended to represent
she approached the basin and bent over it as if to
fill her pitcher  she again lifted it to her head the
personage on the wellbrink now seemed to accost
306
jane eyre
her  to make some requestshe hasted let down
her pitcher on her hand and gave him to drink 
from the bosom of his robe he then produced a
casket opened it and showed magnificent bracelets
and earrings  she acted astonishment and admiration  kneeling he laid the treasure at her feet 
incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
and gestures  the stranger fastened the bracelets on
her arms and the rings in her ears it was eliezer
and rebecca  the camels only were wanting
the divining party again laid their heads together 
apparently they could not agree about the word or
syllable this scene illustrated colonel dent their
 spokesman demanded the tableau of the whole 
whereupon the curtain again descended

on its third rising only a portion of the drawingroom was disclosed  the rest being concealed by a
screen hung with some sort of dark and coarse
drapery the marble basin was removed  in its
place stood a deal table and a kitchen chair  these
objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding
from a horn lantern the wax candles being all
extinguished
amidst this sordid scene sat a man with his
clenched hands resting on his knees and his eyes
bent on the ground i knew mr rochester  though
the begrimed face the disordered dress his coat
hanging loose from one arm as if it had been almost
torn from his back in a scuffle the desperate and
scowling countenance the rough bristling hair
307
jane eyre
might well have disguised him as he moved a
chain clanked  to his wrists were attached fetters
bridewell   exclaimed colonel dent and the
charade was solved
a sufficient interval having elapsed for the
performers to resume their ordinary costumes they
reentered the diningroom mr rochester led in
miss ingram  she was complimenting him on his
acting
 do you know said she that of the three
characters i liked you in the last best  oh had
you but lived a few years earlier what a gallant
gentlemanhighwayman you would have made  
is all the soot washed from my face   he asked
turning it towards her
alas yes  the mores the pity  nothing could
be more becoming to your complexion than that
ruffians rouge 
you would like a hero of the road then  
an english hero of the road would be the next
best thing to an italian bandit and that could only
be surpassed by a levantine pirate
well whatever i am remember you are my
wife we were married an hour since in the presence
of all these witnesses  she giggled and her colour
rose
now dent continued mr rochester  it is
your turn and as the other party withdrew he
and his band took the vacated seats miss ingram
placed herself at her leaders right hand  the other
308
jane eyre
diviners filled the chairs on each side of him and
her i did not now watch the actors  i no longer
waited with interest for the curtain to rise  my
attention was absorbed by the spectators  my eyes
erewhile fixed on the arch were now irresistibly
attracted to the semi circle ofchairs what charade
colonel dent and his party played what word they
chose how they acquitted themselves i no longer
remember  but i still see the consultation which
followed each scene  i see mr rochester turn to
miss ingram and miss ingram to him  i see her
incline her head towards him till the jetty curls
almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
cheek  i hear their mutual whisperings  i recall
their interchanged glances  and something even of
the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in
memory at this moment
i have told you reader that i had learnt to love
mr rochester  i could not unlove him now merely
because i found that he had ceased to notice mebecause i might pass hours in his presence and he
would never once turn his eyes in my directionbecause i saw all his attentions appropriated by a
great lady who scorned to touch me with the hem
of her robes as she passed  who if ever her dark
and imperious eye fell on me by chance would
withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
merit observation i could not unlove him because
i felt sure he would soon marry this very lady—
because i read daily in her a proud security in his
309
jane eyre
intentions respecting her because i witnessed
hourly in him a style of courtship which if careless
and choosing rather to be sought than to seek was
yet in its very carelessness captivating and in its
very pride irresistible
there was nothing to cool or banish love in these
circumstances  though much to create despair
much too you will think reader to engender
jealousy if a woman in my position could presume
to be jealous of a woman in miss ingrams but i
was not jealous or very rarely  the nature of the
pain i suffered could not be explained by that word
miss ingram was a mark beneath jealousy  she was
too inferior to excite the feeling pardon the
seeming paradox  i mean what i say she was
very showy but she was not genuine  she had a fine
person many brilliant attainments  but her mind
was poor her heart barren by nature  nothing
bloomed spontaneously on that soil  no unforced
natural fruit delighted by its freshness she was
not good  she was not original  she used to repeat
sounding phrases from books  she never offered
nor had an opinion of her own she advocated a
high tone of sentiment  but she did not know the
sensations of sympathy and pity  tenderness and
truth were not in her too often she betrayed this
by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy
she had conceived against little adèle  pushing her
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened
to approach her  sometimes ordering her from the
310
jane eyre
room and always treating her with coldness and
acrimony other eyes besides mine watched these
manifestations of characterwatched them closely
keenly shrewdly yes  the future bridegroom mr
rochester himself exercised over his intended a
ceaseless surveillance and it was from this sagacity
this guardedness of histhis perfect clear consciousness of his fair ones defectsthis obvious
absence of passion in his sentiments towards her
that my evertorturing pain arose
i saw he was going to marry her for family
perhaps political reasons  because her rank and
connections suited him  i felt he had not given her
his love and that her qualifications were ill adapted
to win from him that treasure this was the point
this was where the nerve was touched and teazed
this was where the fever was sustained and fed 
she could not charm him
if she had managed the victory at once and he
had yielded and sincerely laid his heart at her feet
i should have covered my face turned to the wall
and figuratively have died to them if miss
ingram had been a good and noble woman endowed
with force fervour kindness sense i should have
had one vital struggle with two tigersjealousy and
despair then my heart torn out and devoured i
should have admired her acknowledged her excellence and been quiet for the rest of my days  and
the more absolute her superiority the deeper would
have been my admiration the more truly tranquil
311
jane eyre
my quiescence but as matters really stood to
watch miss ingrams efforts at fascinating mr 
rochester to witness their repeated failure herself
unconscious that they did fail  vainly fancying that
each shaft launched hit the mark and infatuatedly fpluming herself on success when her pride and selfcomplacency repelled further and further what she
wished to allureto witness this was to be at once
under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint
because when she failed i saw how she might
have succeeded arrows that continually glanced
off from mr rochesters breast and harmless fell at
his feet might i knew if shot by a surer hand have tquivered keen in his proud hearthave called love ainto his stern eye and softness into his sardonic
face or better still without weapons a silent conquest might have been won
why can she not influence him more when she is
privileged to draw so near to him   i asked myself
surely she cannot truly like him  or cannot like
him with true affection  if she did she need not
coin her smiles so lavishly  flash her glances so unremittingly  manufacture airs so elaborate graces so
multitudinous it seems to me that she might by
merely sitting quietly at his side saying little and
looking less get nigher his heart i have seen in
his face a far different expression from that which
hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting
him but then it came of itself it was not elicited
by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres 
312
jane eyre
and one had but to accept itto answer what he
asked without pretension to address him when
needful without grimaceand it increased and grew
kinder and more genial and warmed one like a
fostering sunbeam how will she manage to please
him when they are married  i do not think she will
manage it  and yet it might be managed  and his
wife might i verily believe be the very happiest
woman the sun shines on
i have not yet said anything condemnatory of mr
rochesters project of marrying for interest and connections it surprised me when i first discovered
that such was his intention  i had thought him
a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so
commonplace in his choice of a wife  but the longer
i considered the position education etc  of the
parties the less i felt justified in judging or blaming
either him or miss ingram for acting in conformity
to ideas and principles instilled into them doubtless
from their childhood all their class held these
principles  i supposed then they had reasons for
holding them such as i could not fathom it seemed
to me that were i a gentleman like him i would
take to my bosom only such a wife as i could love 
but the very obviousness of the advantages to the
husbands own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its
general adoption of which i was quite ignorant 
otherwise i felt sure all the world would act as i
wished to act
313
jane eyre
but in other points as well as this i was growing
very lenient to my master  i was forgetting all his
faults for which i had once kept a sharp look out
it had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides
of his character  to take the bad with the good 
and from the just weighing of both to form an
equitable judgment now i saw no bad the
sarcasm that had repelled the harshness that had
startled me once were only like keen condiments in
a choice dish  their presence was pungent but their
absence would be felt as comparatively insipid and
as for the vague something was it a sinister or a
sorrowful a designing or a desponding expression 
that opened upon a careful observer now and then
in his eye and closed again before one could fathom
the strange depth partially disclosed  that something which used to make me fear and shrink as if i
had been wandering amongst volcanic looking hills
and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it
gape that something i at intervals beheld still  and
with throbbing heart but not with palsied nerves
instead of wishing to shun i longed only to dareto
divine it  and i thought miss ingram happy because
one day she might look into the abyss at her
leisure explore its secrets and analyze their nature
meantime while i thought only of my master and
his future bridesaw only them heard only their
discourse and considered only their movements
of importance the rest of the party were occupied
with their own separate interests and pleasures

the ladies lynn and ingram continued to consort
in solemn conferences  where they nodded their
two turbans at each other and held up their
four hands in confronting gestures of surprise
or mystery or horror according to the theme
on which their gossip ran like a pair of magnified puppets mild mrs dent talked with
goodnatured mrs eshton  and the two sometimes
bestowed a courteous word or smile on me
sir george lynn colonel dent and mr eshton discussed politics or county affairs or justice business
lord ingram flirted with amy eshton  louisa
played and sang to and with one of the messrs lynn 
and mary ingram listened languidly to the gallant
speeches of the other sometimes all as with one
consent suspended their by play to observe and
listen to the principal actors  for after all mr
rochester andbecause closely connected with him
miss ingram were the life and soul of the party
if he was absent from the room an hour a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
guests  and his reentrance was sure to give a fresh
impulse to the vivacity of conversation the want
of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly
felt one day that he had been summoned to millcote
on business and was not likely to return till late
the afternoon was wet  a walk the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp lately pitched on a
common beyond hay was consequently deferred
some ofthe gentlemen were gone to the stables  the
315
jane eyre
younger ones together with the young ladies were
playing billiards in the billiardroom the dowagers
ingram and lynn sought solace in a quiet game or
cards blanche ingram after having repelled by
supercilious taciturnity some efforts ofmrs dent and
mrs eshton to draw her into conversation had first
murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on
the piano and then having fetched a novel from the
library had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a
sofa and prepared to beguile by the spell of fiction
the tedious hours of absence the room and the
house were silent  only now and then the merriment of the billiard players was heard from above
it was verging on dusk and the clock had already
given warning of the hour to dress for dinner when
little adèle who knelt by me in the drawingroom
windowseat exclaimed 
voilà monsieur rochester qui revient  
i turned and miss ingram darted forwards from
her sofa the others too looked up from their
several occupations  for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse hoofs
became audible on the wet gravel a post chaise
was approaching
what can possess him to come home in that
style  said miss ingram he rode mesrour  the
black horse  did he not when he went out  and
pilot was with him what has he done with the
animals  
as she said this she approached her tall person
316
jane eyre

f and ample garments so near the window that i was
obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my
spine in her eagerness she did not observe me at
first but when she did she curled her lip and moved
to another casement the post chaise stopped the
driver rang the door bell and a gentleman alighted
attired in travelling garb  but it was not mr
rochester  it was a tall fashionable looking man a
stranger
66 provoking   exclaimed miss ingram   you
tiresome monkey   apostrophizing adèle  who
perched you up in the window to give false intelligence  and she cast on me an angry glance as
if i were in fault
some parleying was audible in the hall and soon
the new comer entered he bowed to lady ingram
as deeming her the eldest lady present
 it appears i come at an inopportune time
madam said he   when my friend mr rochester
is from home but i arrive from a very long journey
and i think i may presume so far an old and
intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here till
he returns 
his manner was polite  his accent in speaking
struck me as being somewhat unusual not precisely
foreign but still not altogether english  his age
might be about mr rochesters between thirty and
forty  his complexion was singularly sallow  otherwise he was a finelooking man at first sight
especially on closer examination you detected
317
jane eyre
something in his face that displeased  or rather
that failed to please his features were regular
but too relaxed his eye was large and well cut but
the life looking out of it was a tame vacant life—at
least so i thought
the sound of the dressingbell dispersed the
party it was not till after dinner that i saw him
again he then seemed quite at his ease but i
liked his physiognomy even less than before  it
struck me as being at the same time unsettled and
inanimate his eye wandered and had no meaning
in its wandering  this gave him an odd look such
as i never remembered to have seen for a handsome and not an unamiable looking man he repelled
me exceedingly  there was no power in that smoothskinned face of a full oval shape  no firmness in
that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth  there
was no thought on the low even forehead  no
command in that blank brown eye
as i sat in my usual nook and looked at him with
the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece
beaming full over himfor he occupied an armchair drawn close to the fire and kept shrinking
still nearer as if he were coldi compared him
with mr rochester i think with deference be it
spoken the contrast could not be much greater
between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon  between
a meek sheep and the rough coated keen eyed dog
its guardian
he had spoken of mr rochester as an old friend
318
jane eyre
t
1
a curious friendship theirs must have been a
pointed illustration indeed of the old adage that
 extremes meet 

two or three of the gentlemen sat near him and
i caught at times scraps of their conversation across
the room at first i could not make much sense of
what i heard  for the discourse of louisa eshton
and mary ingram who sat nearer to me confused
the fragmentary sentences that reached me at
intervals these last were discussing the stranger 
they both called him a  beautiful man  louisa
said he was a  love of a creature  and she “ adored
him   and mary instanced his  pretty little mouth
and nice nose as her ideal of the charming
and what a sweettempered forehead he has  
cried louisa   so smoothnone of those frowning
irregularities i dislike so much and such a placid
eye and smile  
and then to my great relief mr henry lynn
summoned them to the other side of the room to
settle some point about the deferred excursion to
hay common
i was now able to concentrate my attention on the
group by the fire and i presently gathered that the
new comer was called mr mason  then i learnt that
he was but just arrived in england and that he
came from some hot country which was the reason
doubtless his face was so sallow and that he sat so
near the hearth and wore a surtout in the house
presently the words jamaica kingston spanish
319
jane eyre
town indicated the west indies as his residence 
and it was with no little surprise i gathered ere
long that he had there first seen and become
acquainted with mr rochester he spoke of his
friends dislike of the burning heats the hurricanes
and rainy seasons of that region i knew mr
rochester had been a traveller  mrs fairfax had
said so  but i thought the continent of europe had
bounded his wanderings  till now i had never heard
a hint given of visits to more distant shores
i was pondering these things when an incident
and a somewhat unexpected one broke the thread
of my musings mr mason shivering as some one
chanced to open the door asked for more coal to be
put on the fire which had burnt out its flame
though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red
the footman who brought the coal in going out
stopped near mr eshtons chair and said something to him in a low voice of which i heard
only the words  old woman  quite troublesome 
tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she
does not take herself off replied the magistrate
nostop   interrupted colonel dent dont
send her away eshton  we might turn the thing to
account  better consult the ladies and speaking
aloud he continued  ladies you talked of going to
hay common to visit the gipsy camp  sam here
says that one of the old mother bunches is in the
servants hall at this moment and insists upon being
320
jane eyre
rought in before  the quality  to tell them their
ortunes would you like to see her 
66 surely colonel cried lady ingram  you would
ot encourage such a low impostor  dismiss her
y all means at once  
 but i cannot persuade her to go away my lady
aid the footman   nor can any of the servants
irs fairfax is with her just now entreating her to
e gone  but she has taken a chair in the chimneyorner and says nothing shall stir her from it till she
ets leave to come in here 
what does she want  asked mrs eshton
 to tell the gentry their fortunes she says
naam  and she swears she must and will do it
what is she like   inquired the misses eshton
a a breath
 a shockingly ugly old creature miss  almost as
lack as a crock
66 why shes a real sorceress   cried frederick
ynn let us have her in of course
to be sure rejoined his brother   it would be a
housand pities to throw away such a chance of fun ”
my dear boys what are you thinking about  
xclaimed mrs lynn
i cannot possibly countenance any such inconistent proceeding chimed in the dowager ingram
indeed mamma but you canand will  proounced the haughty voice of blanche as she turned
ound on the piano stool  where till now she had
at silent apparently examining sundry sheets of
321 y
jane eyre
music i have a curiosity to hear myfortune told
therefore sam order the beldame forwards 
my darling blanche  recollect
 i do i recollect all you can suggest  and
must have my willquick sam  
yesyesyes   cried all the juveniles botl
ladies and gentlemen  let her comeit will b
excellent sport  
the footman still lingered  she looks such rough one said he
go   ejaculated miss ingram and the ma
went
excitement instantly seized the whole party  arunning fire of raillery and jests was proceeding
when sam returned
she wont come now said he
not her mission to appear before the
 she says it
 vulgar herd
thems her words i must show her into a room
by herself and then those who wish to consult he
must go to her one by one

you see now my queenly blanche  began lad
ingram  she encroaches be advised my ange
girland
show her into the library of course cut in theangel girl  it is not my mission to listen to he
before the vulgar herd either  i mean to have he
all to myself is there a fire in the library  
yes maambut she looks such a tinkler 
cease that chatter blockhead  and do my
bidding 
322
jane eyre
again sam vanished  and mystery animation
expectation rose to full flow once more
shes ready now said the footman as he reappeared  she wishes to know who will be her
first visitor
66 i think i had better just look in upon her before
any ofthe ladies go said colonel dent
 tell her sam a gentleman is coming
sam went and returned
 she says sir that shell have no gentlemen  they
need not trouble themselves to come near her  nor
he added with difficulty suppressing a titter  any
ladies either except the young and single 
 by jove she has taste   exclaimed henry lynn
miss ingram rose solemnly   i go first she said
in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a
forlorn hope mounting a breach in the van of his
men
oh my best  oh my dearest  pausereflect  
was her mammas cry  but she swept past her in
stately silence passed through the door which
colonel dent held open and we heard her enter the
library
a comparative silence ensued lady ingram
thought it le cas  to wring her hands  which she
did accordingly miss mary declared she felt for
her part she never dared venture amy and louisa
eshton tittered under their breath and looked a
little frightened
the minutes passed very slowly  fifteen were
323
jane eyre
counted before the library door again opened miss
ingram returned to us through the arch
would she laugh  would she take it as a joke
all eyes met her with a glance of eager curiosity
and she met all eyes with one ofrebuff and coldness 
she looked neither flurried nor merry  she walked
stiffly to her seat and took it in silence
well blanche   said lord ingram
what did she say sister   asked mary
what did you think  how do you feel  is
she a real fortuneteller   demanded the misses
eshton
now now good people  returned miss ingram
dont press upon me really your organs of
wonder and credulity are easily excited  you seem
by the importance you allmy good mamma
included ascribe to this matterabsolutely to
believe we have a genuine witch in the house who
is in close alliance with the old gentleman i have
seen a gipsyvagabond  she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry and told me
what such people usually tell my whim is gratified 
and now i think mr eshton will do well to put
the hag in the stocks tomorrow morning as he
threatened 
miss ingram took a book leant back in her chair
and so declined further conversation i watched
her for nearly half an hour  during all that time she
never turned a page and her face grew momently
darker more dissatisfied and more sourly expressive
324
jane eyre
of disappointment she had obviously not heard
anything to her advantage  and it seemed to me
from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity that
she herself notwithstanding her professed indifference attached undue importance to whatever
revelations had been made her
meantime mary ingram amy and louisa eshton
declared they dared not go alone  and yet they all
wished to go a negotiation was opened through
the medium of the ambassador sam and after
much pacing to and fro till i think the said sams
calves must have ached with the exercise permission was at last with great difficulty extorted
from the rigorous sybil for the three to wait upon
her in a body
their visit was not so still as miss ingrams had
been  we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks
proceeding from the library  and at the end of
about twenty minutes they burst the door open and
came running across the hall as if they were halfscared out of their wits
im sure she is something not right   they cried
one and all she told us such things  she knows
all about us   and they sank breathless into various
seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them
pressed for further explanation they declared she
had told them of things they had said and done
when they were mere children  described books and
ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home 
keepsakes that different relations had presented to
325
jane eyre
them they affirmed that she had even divined
their thoughts and had whispered in the ear of
each the name of the person she liked best in the
world and informed them of what they most wished
for
here the gentlemen interposed with earnest
petitions to be further enlightened on these two
lastnamed points  but they got only blushes
ejaculations tremors and titters in return for
their importunity the matrons meantime offered
vinaigrettes and wielded fans  and again and again
reiterated the expression of their concern that their
warning had not been taken in time  and the elder
gentlemen laughed and the younger urged their
services on the agitated fair ones
in the midst of the tumult and while my eyes and
ears were fully engaged in the scene before me i
heard a hem close at my elbow  i turned and saw
sam
if you please miss the gipsy declares that there
is another young single lady in the room who has
not been to her yet and she swears she will not go
till she has seen all i thought it must be you
there is no one else for it what shall i tell
her 
oh i will go by all means i answered  and i
was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify
my muchexcited curiosity i slipped out of the
room unobserved by any eyefor the company
were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio
326
jane eyre
just returned and i closed the door quietly behind
me
 ifyou like miss said sam  ill wait in the hall
for you  and if she frightens you just call and ill
come in
66 no sam return to the kitchen  i am not in the
least afraid  nor was i  but i was a good deal
interested and excited
327
chapter xix
the library looked tranquil enough as i entered it
and the sybilif sybil she werewas seated snugly
enough in an easychair at the chimneycorner she
had on a red cloak and a black bonnet  or rather a
broadbrimmed gipsyhat tied down with a striped
handkerchief under her chin an extinguished
candle stood on the table  she was bending over the
fire and seemed reading in a little black book like
a prayerbook by the light of the blaze  she
muttered the words to herself as most old women
do while she read she did not desist immediately
on my entrance  it appeared she wished to finish a
paragraph
i stood on the rug and warmed my hands which
were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the
drawingroom fire i felt now as composed as ever
i did in my life  there was nothing indeed in the
gipsys appearance to trouble ones calm she shut
her book and slowly looked up  her hatbrim
partially shaded her face yet i could see as she
raised it that it was a strange one it looked all
brown and black  elflocks bristled out from beneath
328
jane eyre
12
a white band which passed under her chin and came
half over her cheeks or rather jaws  her eye confronted me at once with a bold and direct gaze
well and you want your fortune told   she said
in a voice as decided as her glance as harsh as her
features
 i dont care about it mother  you may please
yourself but i ought to warn youi have no
faith 
 its like your impudence to say so  i expected
it ofyou  i heard it in your step as you crossed the
threshold 
did you  youve a quick ear
 i have  and a quick eye and a quick brain
you need them all in your trade
 i do  especially when ive customers like you to
deal with why dont you tremble  
im not cold 
why dont you turn pale 
im not sick
why dont you consult my art 
im not silly
the old crone  nichered  a laugh under her
bonnet and bandage  she then drew out a short
black pipe and lighting it began to smoke having
indulged a while in this sedative she raised her
bent body took the pipe from her lips and while
gazing steadily at the fire said very deliberately
you are cold  you are sick  and you are
silly
329
jane eyre
 prove it i rejoined
i will  in a few words you are cold  because
you are alone  no contact strikes the fire from you
that is in you you are sick because the best of
feelings the highest and the sweetest given to man
keeps far away from you you are silly  because
suffer as you may you will not betoken it to
approach  nor will you stir one step to meet it
where it waits for you 
she again put her short black pipe to her lips
and renewed her smoking with vigour
you might say all that to almost anyone who
you knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great
house 
 i might say it to almost any one  but would it
be true of almost any one 
 in my circumstances 
yes just so in your circumstances  but find
me another precisely placed as you are
it would be easy to find you thousands 
 you could scarcely find me one if you knew
it you are peculiarly situated  very near happiness
yes within reach of it the materials are all
prepared  there only wants a movement to combine
them chance laid them somewhat apart  let them
be once approached and bliss results
i dont understand enigmas i never could
guess a riddle in my life
if you wish me to speak more piainly show me
your palm 
330
jane eyre
 and i must cross it with silver i suppose
to be sure 

i gave her a shilling  she put it into an old
stocking foot which she took out of her pocket and
having tied it round and returned it she told me to
hold out my hand i did she approached her
face to the palm and pored over it without touching
it
it is too fine said she
of such a hand as that 
besides what is in a palm 
there
i believe you said i
 i can make nothing
almost without lines 
destiny is not written
no she continued  it is in the faceon the
forehead about the eyes in the eyes themselves
in the lines of the mouth kneel and lift up your
head 
 ah  now you are coming to reality i said as i
obeyed her  i shall begin to put some faith in
you presently
i knelt within half a yard of her she stirred the
fire so that a ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal  the glare however as she sat only
threw her face into deeper shadow  mine it
illumined
i wonder with what feelings you came to me tonight ” she said when she had examined me a while
i wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with
the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a
331
jane eyre
magic lantern  just as little sympathetic communion
passing between you and them as if they were
really mere shadows of human forms and not the
actual substance
i feel tired often sleepy sometimes  but seldom
sad 
then you have some secret hope to buoy you up
and please you with whispers of the future  
not i the utmost i hope is to save money
enough out of my earnings to set up a school some
day in a little house rented by myself 
a mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on 
and sitting in that windowseat you see i know your
habits—
you have learned them from the servants ”
ah  you think yourself sharp wellperhaps
i have to speak truth i have an acquaintance with
one of themmrs poole
i started to my feet when i heard the name
you have—have you   thought i   there is
diablerie in the business after all then  
dont be alarmed continued the strange being
shes a safe hand is mrs poole  close and quiet 
any one may repose confidence in her but as i
was saying  sitting in that window seat do you
think of nothing but your future school  have you tno present interest in any of the company who
occupy the sofas and chairs before you  is there
not one face you study  one figure whose movement you follow with at least curiosity 
332
jane eyre
i like to observe all the faces and all the
figures 
but do you never single one from the restor it may be two  
i do frequently  when the gestures or looks of a
pair seem telling a tale  it amuses me to watch
them 
what tale do you like best to hear  
oh i have not much choice  they generally
run on the same themecourtship  and promise to
end in the same catastrophemarriage
and do you like that monotonous theme  
positively i dont care about it  it is nothing
to me
nothing to you  when a lady young and full
of life and health charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune sits and
smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—”
i what 
you know—and perhaps think well of 
 i dont know the gentlemen here i have
scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them 
and as to thinking well of them i consider some
respectable and stately and middleaged and others
young dashing handsome and lively  but certainly
they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose
i smiles they please without my feeling disposed
to consider the transaction of any moment to
me

you dont know the gentlemen here  you have
333
jane eyre
not exchanged a syllable with one of them  will
you say that of the master of the house 
he is not at home
aprofound remark  a most ingenious quibble 
he went to millcote this morning and will be back
here tonight or tomorrow does that circumstance
exclude him from the list of your acquaintanceblot him as it were out of existence 
no  but i can scarcely see what mr rochester
has to do with the theme you had introduced 
i was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of
gentlemen  and of late so many smiles have been
shed into mr rochesters eyes that they overflow
like two cups filled above the brim  have you never
remarked that  
mr rochester has a right to enjoy the society of
his guests 
no question about his right  but have you never
observed that of all the tales told here about
matrimony mr rochester has been favoured with
the most lively and the most continuous  
the eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue
of a narrator  i said this rather to myself than to
the gipsy  whose strange talk voice manner had
by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream one
unexpected sentence came from her lips after
another till i got involved in a web of mystification 
and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting
for weeks by my heart watching its workings and
taking record of every pulse
334
jane eyre
eagerness of a listener   repeated she  yes 
mr rochester has sat by the hour his ear inclined
to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their
task of communicating  and mr rochester was so
willing to receive and looked so grateful for the
pastime given him  you have noticed this  
grateful  i cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face 
detecting  you have analyzed then and
what did you detect if not gratitude  i said
nothing
you have seen love  have you not —and looking forward you have seen him married and beheld
his bride happy  
humph  not exactly your witchs skill is
rather at fault sometimes 

what the devil have you seen then  
never mind  i came here to inquire not to
confess is it known that mr rochester is to be
married  
yes  and to the beautiful miss ingram 
6
shortly 
appearances would warrant that conclusion  and
no doubt though with an audacity that wants
chastising out of you you seem to question it they
will be a superlatively happy pair he must love
such a handsome noble witty accomplished lady 
and probably she loves him  or if not his person at
least his purse i know she considers the rochester
estate eligible to the last degree  though god
335
jane eyre
pardon me  i told her something on that point
about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
grave the corners of her mouth fell half an inch
i would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out 
if another comes with a longer or clearer rent roll
hes dished
but mother i did not come to hear mr
rochesters fortune  i came to hear my own  and
you have told me nothing of it 
chance
your fortune is yet doubtful  when i examined
your face one trait contradicted another
has meted you a measure of happiness  that i
know i knew it before i came here this evening
she has laid it carefully on one side for you i saw
her do it it depends on yourself to stretch out
your hand and take it up  but whether you will do
so is a problem i study kneel again on the rug
dont keep me long  the fire scorches me
i knelt she did not stoop towards me but only
gazed leaning back in her chair she began muttering
the flame flickers in the eye  the eye shines like
dew  it looks soft and full of feeling  it smiles at
my jargon it is susceptible  impression follows impression through its clear sphere  where it ceases to
smile it is sad  an unconscious lassitude weighs on
the lid that signifies melancholy resulting from
loneliness it turns from me  it will not suffer
farther scrutiny  it seems to deny by a mocking
glance the truth of the discoveries i have already
336
jane eyre
nade —to disown the charge both of sensibility and
hagrin its pride and reserve only confirm me in
ny opinion the eye is favourable
as to the mouth it delights at times in laughter 
t is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives 
hough i dare say it would be silent on much the
eart experiences mobile and flexible it was never
ntended to be compressed in the eternal silence of
olitude it is a mouth which should speak much
nd smile often and have human affection for its
nterlocutor that feature too is propitious
 i see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the
row  and that brow professes to say i can live
lone if selfrespect and circumstances require me
o to do i need not sell my soul to buy bliss  i
ave an inward treasure born with me which can
keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be
vithheld  or offered only at a price i cannot afford
o give the forehead declares  reason sits firm
nd holds the reins and she will not let the feelings
durst away and hurry her to wild chasms the
assions may rage furiously like true heathens as
hey are  and the desires may imagine all sorts of
ain things but judgment shall still have the last
vord in every argument and the casting vote in
very decision strong wind earthquake shock
nd fire may pass by  but i shall follow the guiding
of that still small voice which interprets the dictates
of conscience 
well said forehead  your declaration shall be

jane eyre
respected i have formed my plansright plans ideem themand in them i have attended to the
claims of conscience the counsels of reason
know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish
if in the cup of bliss offered but one dreg of shame
or one flavour of remorse were detected  and i do

protract this moment ad infinitum  but i dare not
so far i have governed myself thoroughly i have
acted as i inwardly swore i would act  but farther
might try me beyond my strength rise miss
eyre  leave me  the play is played out 
where was i  did i wake or sleep  had i
been dreaming  did i dream still  the old
womans voice had changed  her accent her
gesture and all were familiar to me as my own
face in a glassas the speech of my own tonguei got up but did not go i looked  i stirred the
fire and i looked again  but she drew her bonnet
and her bandage closer about her face and again
beckoned me to depart the flame illuminated her
hand stretched out  roused now and on the alert
for discoveries i at once noticed that hand it was
no more the withered limb of eld than my own
it was a rounded supple member with smooth
338
jane eyre
ngers symmetrically turned  a broad ring flashed
n the little finger and stooping forward i looked
t it and saw a gem i had seen a hundred times
efore again i looked at the face which was no
onger turned from me on the contrary the
onnet was doffed the bandage displaced the head
dvanced
well jane do you know me   asked a familiar
oice
66 only take off the red cloak sir and then
but the string is in a knothelp me
break it sir
66

there then off ye lendings   and mr
lochester stepped out of his disguise
now sir what a strange idea  
but well carried out eh  dont you think so  
with the ladies you must have managed well”
but not with you 
you did not act the character of a gipsy with
ae 
what character did i act  my own  
no some unaccountable one in short i
elieve you have been trying to draw me out—or in 
ou have been talking nonsense to make me talk
onsense it is scarcely fair sir 
do you forgive me jane  

 i cannot tell till i have thought it all over if
on reflection i find i have fallen into no great
bsurdity i shall try to forgive you  but it was not
ight
339
jane eyre
oh  you have been very correct very carefulvery sensible 
i reflected and thought on the whole i had it
was a comfort  but indeed i had been on my
guard almost from the beginning of the interviewsomething of masquerade i suspected i knew
gipsies and fortune tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had expressed
herself besides i had noted her feigned voiceher anxiety to conceal her features
but my
mind had been running on grace poolethat
living enigma that mystery of mysteries as i
considered her i had never thought of mr
rochester
well said he what are you musing about what does that grave smile signify  
wonder and self congratulation sir i have
your permission to retire now i suppose 
66 no  stay a moment  and tell me what the
people in the drawingroom yonder are doing
 discussing the gipsy i dare say
sit down let me hear what they said about
me
i had better not stay long sir  it must be near
eleven oclock oh are you aware mr rochester
that a stranger has arrived here since you left this
morning 
a stranger  no  who can it be  i expected
no one is he gone  
no  he said he had known you long and that
340
jane eyre
e could take the liberty of installing himself here
ll you returned 
 the devil he did  did he give his name  
 his name is mason sir  and he comes from the
west indiesfrom spanish town in jamaica i
nink 
mr rochester was standing near me  he had
aken my hand as if to lead me to a chair as i
poke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip  the
mile on his lips froze apparently a spasm caught
is breath
mason the west indies   he said in a tone
ne might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce
ts single words   mason the west indies  he
eiterated  and he went over the syllables three
imes growing in the intervals of speaking whiter
han ashes he hardly seemed to know what he
vas doing

do you feel ill sir   i inquired
jane ive got a blow ive got a blow jane 
he staggered
oh lean on me sir  
66 jane you offered me your shoulder once before 
let me have it now
yes sir yes  and my arm 
he sat down and made me sit beside him holding my hand in both his own he chafed it  gazing on
me at the same time with the most troubled and
dreary look
my little friend   said he  i wish i were in
341
jane eyre
a quiet island with only you  and trouble and danger and hideous recollections removed from me 
can i help you sir —id give my life to serve
you 
 jane if aid is wanted ill seek it at your hands 
i promise you that ”
 thank you sir  tell me what to do—ill try at
least to do it 
 fetch me now jane a glass of wine from the
diningroom  they will be at supper there  and tell
me if mason is with them and what he is doing 
i went i found all the party in the diningrooms
at supper as mr rochester had said  they were not aseated at tablethe supper was arranged on the
sideboard  each had taken what he chose and they
stood about here and there in groups their plates and
glasses in their hands everyone seemed in high
glee  laughter and conversation were general and
animated mr mason stood near the fire talking
to colonel and mrs dent and appeared as merry as t
any of them i filled a wineglass i saw miss
ingram watch me frowningly as i did so  she
thought i was taking a liberty i dare say and i
returned to the library
mr rochesters extreme pallor had disappeared
and he looked once more firm and stern he took
the glass from my hand
here is to your health ministrant spirit   he
said  he swallowed the contents and returned it to t
me what are they doing jane  
342
jane eyre
66 laughing and talking sir 
they dont look grave and mysterious as if they
ad heard something strange  
 not at all they are full of jests and gaiety
 and mason 
 he was laughing too 
if all these people came in a body and spat at
ne what would you do jane
 turn them out of the room sir if i could 
he half smiled but if i were to go to them
nd they only looked at me coldly and whispered
neeringly amongst each other and then dropped off
nd left me one by one what then  would you go
with them 
 i rather think not sir  i should have more
pleasure in staying with you 
to comfort me
66 yes sir to comfort you as well as i could 
 and if they laid you under a ban for adhering
to me
 i probably should know nothing about their
ban  and if i did i should care nothing about it 
then you could dare censure for my sake  
i could dare it for the sake of any friend who
deserved my adherence  as you i am sure do ”
go back now into the room  step quietly up to
mason and whisper in his ear that mr rochester is
come and wishes to see him  show him in here and
then leave me
66 yes sir
343
jane eyre
i did his behest the company all stared at me
as i passed straight among them i sought mr
mason delivered the message and preceded him
from the room  i ushered him into the library and
then i went upstairs
at a late hour after i had been in bed some time
i heard the visitors repair to their chambers  i
distinguished mr rochesters voice and heard him
say this way mason  this is your room 
he spoke cheerfully  the gay tones set my heart
at ease i was soon asleep
344
chapter xx
the
i had forgotten to draw my curtain which i usually
did  and also to let down my windowblind
consequence was that when the moon which was full
and bright for the night was fine came in her
course to that space in the sky opposite my casement and looked in at me through the unveiled
panes her glorious gaze roused me awaking in the
dead of night i opened my eyes on her discsilverwhite and crystal clear it was beautiful but too
solemn  i half rose and stretched my arm to draw
the curtain
good god what a cry
the nightits silenceits rest was rent in twain
by a savage a sharp a shrilly sound that ran from
end to end of thornfield hall
my pulse stopped  my heart stood still  my
stretched arm was paralyzed the cry died and was
not renewed indeed whatever being uttered that
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it  not the
widest winged condor on the andes could twice in
succession send out such a yell from the cloud
345
jane eyre
shrouding his eyrie the thing delivering such
utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort
it came out of the third storey  for it passed
overhead and overheadyes in the room just
above my chamber ceilingi now heard a struggle 
a deadly one it seemed from the noise  and a half
smothered voice shouted
 help  help  help   three times rapidly
will no one come   it cried  and then while
the staggering and stamping went on wildly i
distinguished through plank and plaster —
rochester  rochester  for gods sake come  
a chamberdoor opened  some one ran or rushed
along the gallery another step stamped on the
flooring above and something fell  and there was
silence
i had put on some clothes though horror shook
all my limbs i issued from my apartment the
sleepers were all aroused  ejaculations terrified
murmurs sounded in every room  door after door
unclosed  one looked out and another looked out 
the gallery filled gentlemen and ladies alike had
quitted their beds  and  oh  what is it  — who is
hurt  — what has happened   fetch a light  
is it fire  are there robbers where
shall we run  was demanded confusedly on all
hands but for the moonlight they would have
been in complete darkness they ran to and fro 
they crowded together  some sobbed some stumbled 
the confusion was inextricable
346
jane eyre
where the devil is rochester   cried colonel
dent  i cannot find him in his bed 
 here  here   was shouted in return
composed all of you i am coming 
be
and the door at the end of the gallery opened
and mr rochester advanced with a candle  he had
just descended from the upper storey one of the
ladies ran to him directly  she seized his arm  it
was miss ingram
66 what awful event has taken place   said she
speak  let us know the worst at once  
but dont pull me down or strangle me he
replied  for the misses eshton were clinging about
him now  and the two dowagers in vast white
wrappers were bearing down on him like ships in
full sail
its a
 alls right alls right   he cried
mere rehearsal of  much ado about nothing
ladies keep off  or i shall wax dangerous 
and dangerous he looked  his black eyes darted
sparks calming himself by an effort he added
a servant has had the nightmare  that is all
x shes an excitable nervous person  she construed
her dream into an apparition or something of that
sort no doubt  and has taken a fit with fright
now then i must see you all back into your rooms 
for till the house is settled she cannot be looked
after gentlemen have the goodness to set the
ladies the example miss ingram i am sure you
will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors
347
jane eyre
amy and louisa return to your nests like a pair of
doves as you are mesdames to the dowagers
you will take cold to a dead certainty if you stay
in this chill gallery any longer 
and so by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding he contrived to get them all once more
enclosed in their separate dormitories i did not
wait to be ordered back to mine but retreated unnoticed as unnoticed i had left it
not however to go to bed on the contrary i
began and dressed myself carefully the sounds i
had heard after the scream and the words that had
been uttered had probably been heard only by me 
for they had proceeded from the room above mine 
but they assured me that it was not a servants
dream which had thus struck horror through the
house  and that the explanation mr rochester had
given was merely an invention framed to pacify his
guests i dressed then to be ready for emergencies
when dressed i sat a long time by the window
looking out over the silent grounds and silvered
fields and waiting for i knew not what it seemed
to me that some event must follow the strange cry
struggle and call
no  stillness returned  each murmur and movement ceased gradually and in about an hour  thornfield hall was again as hushed as a desert it
seemed that sleep and night had resumed their
empire meantime the moon declined  she was
about to set not liking to sit in the cold and
348
jane eyre
f
darkness i thought i would lie down on my bed
dressed as i was i left the window and moved
with little noise across the carpet  as i stooped to
take off my shoes a cautious hand tapped low at the
door
 am i wanted   i asked
are you up   asked the voice i expected to
hearviz  my masters
 yes sir 
and dressed 
yes
come out then quietly
i obeyed mr rochester stood in the gallery
holding a light
i want you he said   come this way  take
your time and make no noise 
my slippers sl were thin  i could walk the matted
floor as softly as a cat he glided up the gallery
and up the stairs and stopped in the dark low
corridor of the fateful third storey  i had followed
and stood at his side
 have you a sponge in your room   he asked in
a whisper
yes sir 
have you any saltsvolatile salts  
yes
go back and fetch both 
i returned sought the sponge on the washstand
the salts in my drawer and once more retraced my
steps he still waited  he held a key in his hand 
349
jane eyre
approaching one of the small black doors he put it
in the lock  he paused and addressed me again
you dont turn sick at the sight of blood  
i think i shall not  i have never been tried
yet 
i felt a thrill while i answered him  but no coldness and no faintness
just give me your hand he said   it will not
do to risk a fainting fit
i put my fingers into his warm and steady
was his remark  he turned the key and opened the
door
i saw a room i remembered to have seen before 
the day mrs fairfax showed me over the house  it
was hung with tapestry  but the tapestry was now
looped up in one part and there was a door
apparent which had then been concealed this
door was open  a light shone out of the room
within i heard thence a snarling snatching sound
almost like a dog quarrelling mr rochester
putting down his candle said to me  wait a
minute and he went forward to the inner apartment a shout of laughter greeted his entrance 
noisy at first and terminating in grace pooles own
goblin ha ha  shethen was there he made some
sort of arrangement without speaking  though i
heard a low voice address him he came out and
closed the door behind him

here jane   he said  and i walked round to
the other side of a large bed which with its drawn
350
jane eyre
curtains concealed a considerable portion of the
chamber an easychair was near the bed head  a
man sat in it dressed with the exception of his coat 
he was still  his head leant back  his eyes were
closed mr rochester held the candle over him  i
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless facethe stranger mason  i saw too that his linen on
one side and one arm was almost soaked in blood
hold the candle said mr rochester and i took
it  he
fetched
a
basin
of
water
from
the
washstand


hold
that

said
he

i
obeyed

he
took
the
sponge
 dipped
it
in
and
moistened
the
corpse
like
face

he
asked
for
my
smelling
bottle
 and
applied
it
to
the
nostrils

mr
mason
shortly
unclosed
his
eyes
 he
groaned

mr
rochester
opened
the
shirt
of
the
wounded
man
 whose
arm
and
shoulder
were
bandaged
he
sponged
away
blood

trickling
fast
down

is there immediate danger   murmured mr
mason
pooh noa mere scratch dont be so overcome man  bear up  ill fetch a surgeon for you
now myself youll be able to be removed by
morning i hope jane he continued
sir  
i shall have to leave you in this room with this
gentleman for an hour or perhaps two hours  you
will sponge the blood as i do when it returns 
if he feels faint you will put the glass of water
on that stand to his lips and your salts to his
351
jane eyre
nose you will not speak to him on any pretextandrichardit will be at the peril of your life if
you speak to her  open your lips agitate yourself
and ill not answer for the consequences
again the poor man groaned  he looked as if he
dared not move  fear either of death or of something else appeared almost to paralyze him mr
rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand
and i proceeded to use it as he had done
he
watched me a second then saying  remember —
no conversation he left the room i experienced
a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock and
the sound of his retreating step ceased to be heard
here then i was in the third storey fastened into
one ofits mystic cells  night around me  a pale and
bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands  a
murderess hardly separated from me by a single
door  yes that was appallingthe rest i could
bear  but i shuddered at the thought ofgrace poole
bursting out upon me
i must keep to my post however i must watch
this ghastly countenancethese blue still lips forbidden to unclose these eyes now shut now
opening now wandering through the room now
fixing on me and ever glazed with the dulness of
horror i must dip my hand again and again in the
basin of blood and water and wipe away the trickling
gore i must see the light of the unsnuffed candle
wane on my employment  the shadows darken on
the wrought antique tapestry round me and grow
352
jane eyre
lack under the hangings of the vast old bed and
uiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet
ppositewhose front divided into twelve panels
ore in grim design the heads ofthe twelve apostles
ach enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame 
while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix
nd a dying christ
according as the shifting obscurity and flickering
leam hovered here or glanced there it was now the
bearded physician luke that bent his brow  now
st johns long hair that waved  and anon the
levilish face of judas that grew out of the panel
nd seemed gathering life and threatening a revelaion of the archtraitorof satan himselfin his
ubordinates form
amidst all this i had to listen as well as watch 
o listen for the movements of the wild beast
or the fiend in yonder side den but since mr
rochesters visit it seemed spellbound  all the
night i heard but three sounds at three long
intervals a step creak a momentary renewal of
the snarling canine noise and a deep human
groan
then my own thoughts worried me what crime
was this that lived incarnate in this sequestered
mansion and could neither be expelled nor subdued
by the owner  what mystery that broke out now
in fire and now in blood at the deadest hours of
night  what creature was it that masked in an
ordinary womans face and shape uttered the voice
353 да
jane eyre
now of a mocking demon and anon of a carrionseeking bird of prey 
and this man i bent overthis commonplace
quiet strangerhow had he become involved in the
web of horror  and why had the fury flown at him
what made him seek this quarter of the house at an
untimely season when he should have been asleep
in bed  i had heard mr rochester assign him an
apartment belowwhat brought him here  and
why now was he so tame under the violence or
treachery done him  why did he so quietly submit
to the concealment mr rochester enforced  why
did mr rochester enforce this concealment  his
guest had been outraged his own life on a former
occasion had been hideously plotted against  and
both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in
oblivion  lastly i saw mr mason was submissive to
mr rochester  that the impetuous will of the latter
held complete sway over the inertness of the former 
the few words which had passed between them
assured me of this it was evident that in their
former intercourse the passive disposition of the
one had been habitually influenced by the active
energy of the other  whence then had arisen
mr rochesters dismay when he heard of mr
masons arrival  why had the mere name of
this unresisting individualwhom his word had
sufficed to control like a childfallen on him a
few hours since as a thunderbolt might fall on
an oak 
354
jane eyre
oh i could not forget his look and his paleness
hen he whispered   jane i have got a blowi
ave got a blow jane   i could not forget how the
rm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder 
nd it was no light matter which could thus bow
he resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of
airfax rochester
when will he come  when will he come   i
ried inwardly as the night lingered and lingered3 my bleeding patient drooped moaned sickened 
nd neither day nor aid arrived i had again and
gain offered him the stimulating salts  my efforts
eemed ineffectual  either bodily or mental sufferig or loss of blood or all three combined were fast
rostrating his strength he moaned so and looked
ɔ weak wild and lost i feared he was dying  and
might not even speak to him 
the candle wasted at last went out  as it expired
perceived streaks of grey light edging the window
urtains  dawn was then approaching presently i
eard pilot bark far below out of his distant kennel
a the courtyard  hope revived nor was it unwarranted in five minutes more the grating key
he yielding lock warned me my watch was relieved
it could not have lasted more than two hours  many
week has seemed shorter
mr rochester entered and with him the surgeon
e had been to fetch
now carter be on the alert he said to this
ast  i give you but half an hour for dressing the
355
jane eyre
wound fastening the bandages getting the patient
downstairs and all 
but is he fit to move sir  
no doubt of it  it is nothing serious  he is
nervous his spirit must be kept up come set to
work 
mr rochester drew back the thick curtain drew
up the holland blind let in all the daylight he could and i was surprised and cheered to see how far
dawn was advanced  what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east then he approached
mason whom the surgeon was already handling
now my good fellow how are you   he asked
shes done for me i fear was the faint reply
not a whit courage  this day fortnight youll
hardly be a pin the worse of it  youve lost a little
blood thats all carter assure him theres no
danger
 i can do that conscientiously said carter who
had now undone the bandages   only i wish i could
have got here sooner  he would not have bled so
muchbut how is this  the flesh on the shoulder
is torn as well as cut this wound was not done
with a knife  there have been teeth here  
she bit me he murmured she worried me
like a tigress when rochester got the knife from
her 
you should not have yielded  you should have
grappled with her at once  said mr rochester
but under such circumstances what could one
356
jane eyre
o  returned mason  oh it was frightful he
dded shuddering  and i did not expect it  she
oked so quiet at first 
 i warned you  was his friends answer
 i said
be on your guard when you go near her besides
ou might have waited till tomorrow and had me
ith you it was mere folly to attempt the interview
›night and alone
 i thought i could have done some good 
youthought  you thought  yes  it makes me imatient to hear you  but however you have suffered
nd are likely to suffer enough for not taking my
lvice so ill say no more carterhurry —hurry 
he sun will soon rise and i must have him off
directly sir  the shoulder is just bandaged i
ust look to this other wound in the arm  she has
ad her teeth here too i think 
 she sucked the blood  she said shed drain my
eart  said mason
i saw mr rochester shudder  a singularly
arked expression of disgust horror hatred warped
is countenance almost to distortion  but he only
aid
come be silent richard and never mind her
ibberish  dont repeat it 
i wish i could forget it was the answer
you will when you are out of the country  when
ou get back to spanish town you may think of her
s dead and buriedor rather you need not think
of her at all 
357
jane eyre

impossible to forget this night  
it is not impossible  have some energy man
you thought you were as dead as a herring two
hours since and you are all alive and talking now
there carter has done with you or nearly so  ill
make you decent in a trice jane  he turned to
me for the first time since his reentrance  take
this key go down to my bedroom and walk straight
forward into mydressingroom  open the top drawer
of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neckhandkerchief  bring them here  and be nimble 
i went  sought the repository he had mentioned
found the articles named and returned with them
now said he go to the other side of the bed
while i order his toilet  but dont leave the room 
you may be wanted again 
i retired as directed
was anybody stirring below when you went
down jane   inquired mr rochester presently
no sir  all was very still 
we shall get you off cannily dick  and it will
be better both for your sake and for that of the poor
creature in yonder i have striven long to avoid
exposure and i should not like it to come at last
here carter help him on with his waistcoat
where did you leave your furred cloak  you cant
travel a mile without that i know in this damned
cold climate in your room  jane run down to
mr masons roomthe one next mineand fetch a
cloak you will see there 
358
jane eyre
again i ran and again returned bearing an
mmense mantle lined and edged with fur
now ive another errand for you said my uniring master   you must away to my room again
what a mercy you are shod with velvet jane la
lodhopping messenger would never do at this
uncture you must open the middle drawer of my
oilettable and take out a little phial and a little
lass you will find therequick  
i flew thither and back bringing the desired
vessels
thats well  now doctor i shall take the liberty
of administering a dose myself on my own responibility i got this cordial at rome of an italian
charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked carter
it is not athing to be used indiscriminately but it is
good upon occasion  as now for instance jane a
little water 
he held out the tiny glass and i half filled it from
the waterbottle on the washstand
 that will do now wet the lip of the phial
i did so he measured twelve drops of a crimson
liquid and presented it to mason
drink richard  it will give you the heart you
lack for an hour or so 
 but will it hurt me —is it inflammatory
drink  drink  drink  
mr mason obeyed because it was evidently useless to resist he was dressed now  he still looked
pale but he was no longer gory and sullied mr
359
jane eyre
rochester let him sit three minutes after he had
swallowed the liquid  he then took his arm
now i am sure you can get on your feet  he
said  try 
the patient rose
carter take him under the other shoulder be
of good cheer richard  step out  thats it  
i do feel better remarked mr mason
 i am sure you do now jane trip on before us
away to the backstairs  unbolt the sidepassage
door and tell the driver of the postchaise you will
see in the yardor just outside for i told him not
to drive his rattling wheels over the pavementto
be ready  we are coming  and jane if anyone is
about come to the foot of the stairs and hem 
it was by this time halfpast five and the sun
was on the point of rising  but i found the kitchen
still dark and silent the sidepassage door was
fastened  i opened it with as little noise as possible 
all the yard was quiet  but the gates stood wide
open and there was a postchaise with horses ready
harnessed and driver seated on the box stationed
outside i approached him and said the gentlemen
were coming  he nodded  then i looked carefully
round and listened the stillness of early morning
slumbered everywhere  the curtains were yet drawn
over the servants chamber windows  little birds
were just twittering in the blossombranched orchard
trees whose boughs drooped like white garlands
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard  the
360
jane eyre
carriage horses stamped from time to time in their
closed stables  all else was still
the gentlemen now appeared mason supported
by mr rochester and the surgeon seemed to walk
with tolerable ease  they assisted him into the
chaise  carter followed
 take care of him  said mr rochester to the
atter  and keep him at your house till he is quite
well  i shall ride over in a day or two to see how he
gets on richard how is it with you  
 the fresh air revives me fairfax 
leave the window open on his side carter 
there is no windgoodbye dick ”
fairfax66
3
well what is it  
let her be taken care of  let her be treated as
tenderly as may be let her he stopped and burst
into tears
 i do my best  and have done it and will do it
was the answer  he shut up the chaise door and the
vehicle drove away
yet would to god there was an end of all this  
added mr rochester as he closed and barred the
heavy yard gates this done he moved with slow
step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall
bordering the orchard i supposing he had done
with me prepared to return to the house  again
however i heard him call  jane   he had opened
the portal and stood at it waiting for me
come where there is some freshness for a few
361
jane eyre
moments he said   that house is a mere dungeon 
dont you feel it so 
it seems to me a splendid mansion sir ”
the glamour of inexperience is over your eyes
he answered  and you see it through a charmed
medium  you cannot discern that the gilding is
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs  that the
marble is sordid slate and the polished woods mere
refuse chips and scaly bark now here he
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered is
all real sweet and pure

9
he strayed down a walk edged with box  with
appletrees peartrees and cherrytrees on one side
and a border on the other full of all sorts of oldfashioned flowers stocks sweet williams primroses
pansies mingled with southernwood sweetbriar and
various fragrant herbs they were fresh now as a
succession of april showers and gleams followed by
a lovely spring morning could make them  the sun
was just entering the dappled east and his light
illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and
shone down the quiet walks under them
jane will you have a flower 
he gathered a halfblown rose the first on the
bush and offered it to me
thank you sir
 do you like this sunrise jane  that sky with
its high and light clouds which are sure to melt
away as the day waxes warmthis placid and balmy
atmosphere  
362
jane eyre
 i do very much
you have passed a strange night jane 
 yes sir
 and it has made you look palewere you afraid
when i left you alone with mason 
 i was afraid of some one coming out of the
inner room 
 but i had fastened the doori had the key in
my pocket  i should have been a careless shepherd
if i had left a lambmy pet lambso near a wolfs
den unguarded  you were safe 
will grace poole live here still sir  
oh yes  dont trouble your head about her—
put the thing out of your thoughts 
yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure
while she stays 
never feari will take care of myself 
is the danger you apprehended last night gone
by now sir 
 i cannot vouch for that till mason is out of england  nor even then to live for me jane is to
stand on a crater crust which may crack and spew
fire any day
 but mr mason seems a man easily led your
influence sir is evidently potent with him he will
never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you 
 oh no  mason will not defy me  nor knowing
it will he hurt mebut unintentionally he might
in a moment by one careless word deprive me if
not of life yet for ever of happiness
363
jane eyre
tell him to be cautious sir  let him know what
you fear and show him how to avert the danger 
he laughed sardonically hastily took my hand
and as hastily threw it from him
if i could do that simpleton where would the
danger be  annihilated in a moment ever since
i have known mason i have only to say to him ‘ do
that and the thing has been done but i cannot
give him orders in this case  i cannot say  beware
of harming me richard   for it is imperative that i
should keep him ignorant that harm to me is
possible now you look puzzled  and i will puzzle
you farther you are my little friend are you not  
 i like to serve you sir and to obey you in all
that is right
precisely  i see you do i see genuine contentment in your gait and mien your eye and face when
you are helping me and pleasing meworking for
me and with me in as you characteristically say
all that is right   for if i bid you do what you
thought wrong there would be no lightfooted
running no neathanded alacrity no lively glance
and animated complexion my friend would then
turn to me quiet and pale and would say  no sir 
that is impossible  i cannot do it because it is
wrong   and would become immutable as a fixed
star well you too have power over me and may
injure me  yet i dare not show you where i am
vulnerable lest faithful and friendly as you are you
should transfix me at once 
364
jane eyre
 if you have no more to fear from mr mason
than you have from me sir you are very safe
god grant it may be so 
arbour  sit down 
here jane is an
the arbour was an arch in the wall lined with
ivy  it contained a rustic seat mr rochester took
it leaving room however for me  but i stood
before him
sit  he said  the bench is long enough for
two you dont hesitate to take a place at my side
do you  is that wrong jane  
i answered him by assuming it  to refuse would
i felt have been unwise
now my little friend while the sun drinks the
dewwhile all the flowers in this old garden awake
and expand and the birds fetch their young ones
breakfast out of the thornfield and the early bees
do their first spell of workill put a case to you
which you must endeavour to suppose your own 
but first look at me and tell me you are at ease
and not fearing that i err in detaining you or that
you err in staying 
no sir  i am content 
well then jane call to aid your fancy suppose you were no longer a girl well reared and
disciplined but a wild boy indulged from childhood
upwards  imagine yourself in a remote foreign land 
conceive that you there commit a capital error no
matter of what nature or from what motives but
one whose consequences must follow you through
365
jane eyre
life and taint all your existence mind  i dont say
a crime  i am not speaking of shedding of blood or
any other guilty act which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law  my word is error the
results of what you have done become in time to
you utterly insupportable  you take measures to
obtain relief  unusual measures but neither unlawful nor culpable still you are miserable  for
hope has quitted you on the very confines of life
your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse which you
feel will not leave it till the time of setting bitter
and base associations have become the sole food of
your memory  you wander here and there seeking
rest in exile  happiness in pleasurei mean in
heartless sensual pleasuresuch as dulls intellect
and blights feeling heart weary and soul withered
you come home after years of voluntary banishment 
you make a new acquaintancehow or where no
matter  you find in this stranger much ofthe good
and bright qualities which you have sought for
twenty years and never before encountered  and
they are all fresh healthy without soil and without
taint such society revives regenerates  you feel
better days come backhigher wishes purer feelings 
you desire to recommence your life and to spend
what remains to you of days in a way more worthy
of an immortal being to attain this end are you
justified in overleaping an obstacle of customa
mere conventional impediment which neither your
conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves  
366
jane eyre
he paused for an answer  and what was i to say
oh for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and
satisfactory response  vain aspiration  the west
wind whispered in the ivy round me  but no
gentle ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of
speech  the birds sang in the treetops  but their
song however sweet was inarticulate
again mr rochester propounded his query
 is the wandering and sinful but now rest seeking
and repentant man justified in daring the worlds
opinion in order to attach to him for ever this
gentle gracious genial stranger  thereby securing
his own peace of mind and regeneration of life  
 sir i answered  a wanderers repose or a
sinners reformation should never depend on a fellowcreature men and women die  philosophers falter
in wisdom and christians in goodness  if any one
you know has suffered and erred let him look higher
than his equals for strength to amend and solace to
heal 
 but the instrumentthe instrument  god who
does the work ordains the instrument i have
myselfi tell it you without parablebeen a
worldly dissipated restless man  and i believe i
have found the instrument for my cure in
he paused  the birds went on carolling the leaves
lightly rustling i almost wondered they did not
check their songs and whispers to catch the suspended revelation  but they would have had to wait
many minutesso long was the silence protracted
367
jane eyre
at last i looked up at the tardy speaker  he was
looking eagerly at me
little friend said he in quite a changed tonewhile his face changed too  losing all its softness
and gravity and becoming harsh and sarcasticyou have noticed my tender penchant for miss
ingram  dont you think if i married her she would
regenerate me with a vengeance  
66
he got up instantly went quite to the other end
of the walk and when he came back he was humming a tune
66 jane jane said he stopping before me “ you
are quite pale with your vigils  dont you curse me
for disturbing your rest  
curse you  no sir 
shake hands in confirmation ofthe word what
cold fingers  they were warmer last night when i
touched them at the door of the mysterious chamber
jane when will you watch with me again  
whenever i can be useful sir
 for instance the night before i am married  i
am sure i shall not be able to sleep will you
promise to sit up with me to bear me company 
to you i can talk of my lovely one for now you
have seen her and know her 

yes sir 
 shes a rare one is she not jane 
yes sir 
a strappera real strapper jane  big brown
and buxom  with hair just such as the ladies of
368
jane eyre

carthage must have had
and lynn in the stables 
through that wicket
bless me  theres dent
go in by the shrubbery
as i went one way he went another and i heard
him in the yard saying cheeringly—
mason got the start of you all this morning  he
was gone before sunrise  i rose at four to see him
off

chapter xxi
presentiments are strange things  and so are sympathies and so are signs  and the three combined
make one mystery to which humanity has not yet
found the key i never laughed at presentiments in
my life because i have had strange ones of my own
sympathies i believe exist  for instance between
fardistant long absent wholly estranged relatives 
asserting notwithstanding their alienation the unity
of the source to which each traces his origin whose
workings baffle mortal comprehension and signs
for aught we know may be but the sympathies of
nature with man
when i was a little girl only six years old i one
night heard bessie leaven say to martha abbot
that she had been dreaming about a little child  and
that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble
either to onesself or ones kin the saying might
have worn out of my memory had not a circumstance
immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it
there the next day bessie was sent for home to
the deathbed of her little sister
of late i had often recalled this saying and this
370
jane eyre
cident  for during the past week scarcely a night
ad gone over my couch that had not brought with
 a dream of an infant which i sometimes hushed
1 my arms sometimes dandled on my knee somemes watched playing with daisies on a lawn or
gain dabbling its hands in running water it was
wailing child this night and a laughing one the
ext  now it nestled close to me and now it ran
rom me  but whatever mood the apparition
vinced whatever aspect it wore it failed not for
even successive nights to meet me the moment i
ntered the land of slumber
i did not like this iteration of one ideathis
trange recurrence of one image  and i grew
ervous as bedtime approached and the hour of
he vision drew near it was from companionship
with this babyphantom i had been roused on that
noonlight night when i heard the cry  and it was on
he afternoon of the day following i was summoned
lownstairs by a message that some one wanted me
n mrs fairfaxs room on repairing thither i
ound a man waiting for me having the appearance
of a gentlemans servant  he was dressed in deep
nourning and the hat he held in his hand was
surrounded with a crape band
 i dare say you hardly remember me miss  he
said rising as i entered   but my name is leaven
i lived coachman with mrs reed when you were at
gateshead eight or nine years since and i live there
estill 
371
jane eyre
oh robert  how do you do  i remember you
very well you used to give me a ride sometimes on
miss georgianas bay pony and how is bessie 
you are married to bessie 
yes miss  my wife is very hearty thank you 
she brought me another little one about two months w
since we have three nowand both mother and
child are thriving 
and are the family well at the house robert 
 im sorry i cant give you better news of them
miss  they are very badly at presentin great
trouble 
i hope no one is dead  i said glancing at his
black dress he too looked down at the crape
round his hat and replied
mr john died yesterday was a week at his
chambers in london
mr john  
yes 
and how does his mother bear it 
why you see miss eyre it is not a common
mishap his life has been very wild  these last three
years he gave himself up to strange ways  and his
death was shocking
 i heard from bessie he was not doing well 
 doing well  he could not do worse  he ruined
his health and his estate amongst the worst men
and the worst women he got into debt and into
jail his mother helped him out twice but as soon
as he was free he returned to his old companion
372
jane eyre
ad habits his head was not strong  the knaves
e lived amongst fooled him beyond anything i ever
eard he came down to gateshead about three
eeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him
lissis refused  her means have long been much
educed by his extravagance  so he went back again
nd the next news was that he was dead how he
ied god knows they say he killed himself 
i was silent the tidings were frightful robert
eaven resumed
 missis had been out of health herself for some
ime she had got very stout but was not strong
vith it and the loss of money and fear of poverty
vere quite breaking her down the information
bout mr johns death and the manner of it came
oo suddenly it brought on a stroke she was
hree days without speaking  but last tuesday she
seemed rather better  she appeared as if she wanted
to say something and kept making signs to my wife
and mumbling it was only yesterday morning
however that bessie understood she was pronouncing your name  and at last she made out the words
bring janefetch jane eyre  i want to speak to
her bessie is not sure whether she is in her right
mind or means anything by the words  but she told
miss reed and miss georgiana and advised them to
send for you the young ladies put it off at first 
but their mother grew so restless and said  jane
jane so many times that at last they consented i
left gateshead yesterday  and if you can get ready
373
jane eyre
miss i should like to take you back with me early
tomorrow morning
66 yes robert i shall be ready  it seems to me
that i ought to go 
i think so too miss bessie said she was sure
you would not refuse but i suppose you will have
to ask leave before you can get off
yes  and i will do it now   and having directed
him to the servants hall and recommended him to
the care of johns wife and the attentions of john
himself i went in search of mr rochester
he was not in any of the lower rooms  he was not
in the yard the stables or the grounds i asked
mrs fairfax if she had seen him yes she believed
he was playing billiards with miss ingram to the
billiardroom i hastened  the click of balls and the
hum of voices resounded thence  mr rochester
miss ingram the two misses eshton and their
admirers were all busied in the game it required
some courage to disturb so interesting a party  my
errand however was one i could not defer so i
approached the master where he stood at miss
ingrams side she turned as i drew near and
looked at me haughtily  her eyes seemed to demand
what can the creeping creature want now   and
when i said in a low voice  mr rochester she
made a movement as if tempted to order me away
i remember her appearance at the momentit was
very graceful and very striking  she wore a morning
robe of skyblue crape  a gauzy azure scarf was
374
jane eyre
wisted in her hair she had been all animation
vith the game and irritated pride did not lower
he expression of her haughty lineaments
does that person want you   she inquired of
mr rochester  and mr rochester turned to see who
he person was he made a curious grimace
one of his strange and equivocal demonstrationschrew down his cue and followed me from the room
well jane   he said as he rested his back
against the schoolroom door which he had shut
66
 if you please sir i want leave of absence for a
week or two 
 what to do where to go 
to see a sick lady who has sent for me 
 what sick lady where does she live  
at gateshead in shire 
 shire  that is a hundred miles off who
may she be that sends for people to see her that
distance  
her name is reed sir mrs reed 
 reed of gateshead 
gateshead a magistrate 
it is his widow sir 
there was a reed of
 and what have you to do with her  how do
you know her  
 mr reed was my uncle my mothers brother 
the deuce he was  you never told me that
before you always said you had no relations 
none that would own me sir mr reed is
dead and his wife cast me off 
375
jane eyre
6
why
 because i was poor and burdensome and she
disliked me 

but reed left children you must have cousins 
sir george lynn was talking of a reed of gateshead
yesterdaywho he said was one of the veriest
rascals on town  and ingram was mentioning a
georgiana reed of the same place who was much
admired for her beauty a season or two ago in
london 
john reed is dead too sir  he ruined himself
and halfruined his family and is supposed to have
committed suicide the news so shocked his
mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack 
and what good can you do her  nonsense
jane  i would never think of running a hundred
miles to see an old lady who will perhaps be dead
before you reach her  besides you say she cast
you off
yes sir but that is long ago  and when her
circumstances were very different  i could not be
easy to neglect her wishes now 
how long will you stay
 as short a time as possible sir 
promise me only to stay a week—”
 i had better not pass my word  i might be
obliged to break it 
at all events you will come back  you will not
be induced under any pretext to take up a
permanent residence with her  
376
jane eyre
 oh no  i shall certainly return if all be well 
 and who goes with you  you dont travel a
hundred miles alone
66 no sir  she has sent her coachman
a person to be trusted 
 yes sir  he has lived ten years in the family 
mr rochester meditated when do you wish
to go
66 early tomorrow morning sir 
well you must have some money  you cant
travel without money and i dare say you have not
much i have given you no salary yet how
much have you in the world jane   he asked
smiling
i drew out my pursea meagre thing it was
five shillings sir  he took the purse poured
the hoard into his palm and chuckled over it as if
its scantiness pleased him soon he produced his
pocketbook here said he offering me a note 
it was fifty pounds and he owed me but fifteen i
told him i had no change
 i dont want change  you know that take
your wages 
i declined accepting more than was my due he
scowled at first  then as if recollecting something
he said 
right right  better not give you all now  you
would perhaps stay away three months if you had
fifty pounds there are ten  is it not plenty  
yes sir  but now you owe me five 
377
jane eyre
come back for it then  i am your banker for
forty pounds 
mr rochester i may as well mention another
matter of business to you while i have the opportunity
matter of business  im curious to hear it 
you have as good as informed me sir that you
are going shortly to be married  
yes what then  
 in that case sir adèle ought to go to school  i
am sure you will perceive the necessity of it
to get her out of my brides way  who might
otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically
theres sense in the suggestion  not a doubt of it
adèle as you say must go to school  and you of
course must march straight to the devil  
 i hope not sir  but i
situation somewhere 
must seek another
 in course   he exclaimed with a twang of voice
and a distortion of features equally fantastic and
ludicrous he looked at me some minutes
and old madam reed or the misses her
daughters will be solicited by you to seek a place i
suppose  
66 no sir  i am not on such terms with my
relatives as would justify me in asking favours of
thembut i shall advertise
you shall walk up the pyramids of egypt   he
growled  at your peril you advertise  i wish i
had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
378
jane eyre
pounds give me back nine pounds jane  ive a
use for it
eg
tead
and so have i sir i returned putting my
hands and my purse behind me i could not
spare the money on any account
 little niggard   said he  refusing me a
pecuniary request  give me five pounds jane 
not five shillings sir  nor five pence 
just let me look at the cash 
 no sir  you are not to be trusted 
 jane 
 sir 
 promise me one thing
 ill promise you anything sir that i think i am
likely to perform
not to advertise and to trust this quest of a
situation to me ill find you one in time
 i shall be glad so to do sir if you in your turn
will promise that i and adèle shall be both safe out
of the house before your bride enters it
very well  very well  ill pledge my word on it
you go tomorrow then  
yes sir early
shall you come down to the drawingroom after
dinner  
no sir i must prepare for the journey
then you and i must bid goodbye for a little
while 
i suppose so sir 
and how do people perform that ceremony of
379
jane eyre
parting jane  teach me  i am not quite up to
it
they say farewell  or any other form they
prefer 
then say it 
farewell mr rochester for the present 
what must i say
the same if you like sir 

farewell miss eyre for the present is that
all  
 yes
it seems stingy to my notions and dry and
unfriendly i should like something else  a little
addition to the rite if one shook hands for
instance  but no that would not content me
either so youll do no more than say farewell
jane 
it is enough sir  as much goodwill may be
conveyed in one hearty word as in many
66 very likely  but it is blank and cool farewell 
how long is he going to stand with his back
against that door   i asked myself   i want to
commence my packing  the dinnerbell rang and
suddenly away he bolted without another syllable 
i saw him no more during the day and was off
before he had risen in the morning
i reached the lodge at gateshead about five
oclock in the afternoon of the first of may  i
stepped in there before going up to the hall it
380
jane eyre
was very clean and neat  the ornamental windows
were hung with little white curtains  the floor was
spotless  the grate and fire irons were burnished
bright and the fire burned clear bessie sat on the
hearth nursing her last born and robert and his
sister played quietly in a corner
bless you —i knew you would come   exclaimed mrs leaven as i entered
yes bessie said i after i had kissed her 
 and i trust i am not too late how is mrs reed 
alive still i hope
yes she is alive  and more sensible and collected than she was the doctor says she may
linger a week or two yet  but he hardly thinks she
will finally recover 
 has she mentioned me lately 
she was talking of you only this morning and
wishing you would come  but she is sleeping now 
or was ten minutes ago when i was up at the house
she generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon and wakes up about six or seven will you
rest yourself here an hour miss and then i will go
up with you 
robert here entered and bessie laid her sleeping
child in the cradle and went to welcome him  afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and
having some tea  for she said i looked pale and
tired i was glad to accept her hospitality  and i
submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as
passively as i used to let her undress me when a child
381
jane eyre
old times crowded fast back on me as i watched
her bustling aboutsetting out the teatray with
her best china cutting bread and butter toasting a
teacake and between whiles giving little robert
or jane an occasional tap or push just as she used
to give me in former days bessie had retained her
quick temper as well as her light foot and good
looks
tea ready i was going to approach the table  but
she desired me to sit still quite in her old peremptory tones i must be served at the fireside she
said  and she placed before me a little round stand
with my cup and a plate of toast absolutely as she
used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair  and i smiled and
obeyed her as in bygone days
she wanted to know if i was happy at thornfield
hall and what sort of a person the mistress was 
and when i told her there was only a master
whether he was a nice gentleman and if i liked him
i told her he was rather an ugly man but quite a
gentleman  and that he treated me kindly and i
was content then i went on to describe to her the
gay company that had lately been staying at the
house  and to these details bessie listened with
interest  they were precisely of the kind she
relished
in such conversation an hour was soon gone 
bessie restored to me my bonnet etc  and accompanied by her i quitted the lodge for the hall it
382
jane eyre
as also accompanied by her that i had nearly nine
ears ago walked down the path i was now ascendng on a dark misty raw morning in january i
ad left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered hearta sense of outlawry and almost of
eprobationto seek the chilly harbourage of
lowood that bourne so far away and unexplored
the same hostile roof now again rose before me 
ny prospects were doubtful yet  and i had yet an
ching heart i still felt as a wanderer on the face
of the earth  but i experienced firmer trust in
nyself and my own powers and less withering dread
of oppression the gaping wound of my wrongs
oo was now quite healed  and the flame of resentnent extinguished
 you shall go into the breakfastroom first said
bessie as she preceded me through the hall   the
young ladies will be there
in another moment i was within that apartment
there was every article of furniture looking just as
it did on the morning i was first introduced to mr
brocklehurst  the very rug he had stood upon still
covered the hearth glancing at the bookcases i
thought i could distinguish the two volumes of
bewicks british birds occupying their old place on
the third shelf and gullivers travels and the
arabian nights ranged just above the inanimate
objects were not changed  but the living things had
ltered past recognition
hal
two young ladies appeared before me  one very
383
jane eyre
tall almost as tall as miss ingram —very thin toowith a sallow face and severe mien there was
something ascetic in her look which was augmented
by the extreme plainness of a straightskirted blackstuff dress a starched linen collar hair combed
away from the temples and the nunlike ornament
of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix this i
felt sure was eliza though i could trace little
resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
colourless visage
the other was as certainly georgiana  but not
like the georgiana i remembered the slim and
fairylike girl of eleven this was a fullblown very
plump damsel fair as waxwork  with handsome
and regular features languishing blue eyes and
ringleted yellow hair the hue of her dress was
black too  but its fashion was so different from her
sisters so much more flowing and becomingit
looked as stylish as the others looked puritanical
in each of the sisters there was one trait of the
mother and only one  the thin and pallid elder
daughter had her parents cairngorm eye  the
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour
ofjaw and chin perhaps a little softened but still
imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom
both ladies as i advanced rose to welcome me
and both addressed me by the name of  miss eyre 
elizas greeting was delivered in a short abrupt
voice without a smile  and then she sat down again
384
jane eyre
xed her eyes on the fire and seemed to forget me
leorgiana added to her  how dye do   several
commonplaces about my journey the weather and
on uttered in rather a drawling tone and
ccompanied by sundry sideglances that measured
e from head to footnow traversing the folds of
my drab merino pelisse and now lingering on the
lain trimming of my cottage bonnet young ladies
ave a remarkable way of letting you know that they
hink you a  quiz without actually saying the
words a certain superciliousness of look coolness
f manner nonchalance of tone express fully their
entiments on the point without committing them
y any positive rudeness in word or deed
a sneer however whether covert or open had
how no longer that power over me it once possessed 
i sat between my cousins i was surprised to find
ow easy i felt under the total neglect of the one
ad the semi sarcastic attentions of the other
 liza did not mortify nor georgiana ruffle me the
ct was i had other things to think about  within
e last few months feelings had been stirred in me
much more potent than any they could raiseains and pleasures so much more acute and
quisite had been excited than any it was in their
ower to inflict or bestowthat their airs gave me
ɔ concern either for good or bad
howis mrs reed   i asked soon looking calmly
ori georgiana  who thought fit to bridle at the direct
adress as if it were an unexpected liberty
385 сс
jane eyre
mrs reed  ah mamma you mean  she is
extremely poorly i doubt if you can see her tonight
if said i  you would just step upstairs and
tell her i am come i should be much obliged to
you 
georgiana almost started and she opened her
blue eyes wild and wide i know she had a
particular wish to see me i added  and i would
not defer attending to her desire longer than is
absolutely necessary

mamma dislikes being disturbed in an evening
remarked eliza i soon rose quietly took off my
bonnet and gloves uninvited and said i would just
step out to bessiewho was i dared say in the
kitchen and ask her to ascertain whether mrs
reed was disposed to receive me or not tonight i
went and having found bessie and despatched her
on my errand i proceeded to take further measures
it had heretofore been my habit always to shrink
from arrogance  received as i had been today i
should a year ago have resolved to quit gateshead
the very next morning  now it was disclosed to me
all at once that that would be a foolish plan i had
taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt
and i must stay with her till she was betteror
dead as to her daughters pride or folly i must
put it on one side  make myself independent of it
so i addressed the housekeeper  asked her to show
me a room told her i should probably be a visitor
386
jane eyre
here for a week or two had my trunk conveyed to
my chamber and followed it thither myself  i met
bessie on the landing
missis is awake she said   i have told her you
are here  come and let us see if she will know you
i did not need to be guided to the wellknown
room to which i had so often been summoned for
chastisement or reprimand in former days i
hastened before bessie i softly opened the door  a
shaded light stood on the table for it was now
getting dark there was the great four post bed
with amber hangings as of old  there the toilettable
the armchair and the foot stool  at which i had a
hundred times been sentenced to kneel to ask
pardon for offences by me uncommitted i looked
into a certain corner near half expecting to see the
slim outline of a oncedreaded switch which used to
lurk there waiting to leap out implike and lace my
quivering palm or shrinking neck i approached
the bed i opened the curtains and leant over the
highpiled pillows
well did i remember mrs reeds face and i
eagerly sought the familiar image it is a happy
thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion 
i had left this woman in bitterness and hate and i
came back to her now with no other emotion than a
sort of ruth for her great sufferings and a strong
yearning to forget and forgive all injuriesto be
reconciled and clasp hands in amity
387
jane eyre
the wellknown face was there  stern relentless
as ever there was that peculiar eye which nothing
could melt  and the somewhat raised imperious
despotic eyebrow how often had it lowered on me
menace and hate  and how the recollection ofchildhoods terrors and sorrows revived as i traced its
harsh line now and yet i stooped down and kissed
her  she looked at me
 is this jane eyre   she said
yes aunt reed how are you dear aunt  
i had once vowed that i would never call her aunt
again i thought it no sin to forget and break that
vow now my fingers had fastened on her hand
which lay outside the sheet  had she pressed mine
kindly i should at that moment have experienced
true pleasure but unimpressionable natures are
not so soon softened nor are natural antipathies so
readily eradicated  mrs reed took her hand away
and turning her face rather from me she remarked
that the night was warm again she regarded me
so icily i felt at once that her opinion of meher
feeling towards mewas unchanged and unchangeable i knew by her stony eyeopaque to tenderness indissoluble to tearsthat she was resolved to
consider me bad to the last  because to believe me
good would give her no generous pleasure  only a
sense of mortification
i felt pain and then i felt ire  and then i felt a
determination to subdue herto be her mistress in
spite both of her nature and her will my tears had
388
jane eyre
risen just as in childhood  i ordered them back to
their source i brought a chair to the bed head  i
sat down and leaned over the pillow
you sent for me i said  and i am here  and
it is my intention to stay till i see how you get on
oh of course  you have seen my daughters 
yes
66
66well you may tell them i wish you to stay till
i can talk some things over with you i have on my
mind tonight it is too late and i have a difficulty
in recalling them but there was something i
wished to saylet me see
the wandering look and changed utterance told
what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous
frame turning restlessly she drewthe bed clothes
round her my elbow resting on a corner of the
quilt fixed it down  she was at once irritated
sit up   said she   dont annoy me with holding the clothes fastare you jane eyre  
66 i am jane eyre
i have had more trouble with that child than any
one would believe such a burden to be left on my
hands and so much annoyance as she caused me
daily and hourly with her incomprehensible disposition and her sudden starts of temper and her
continual unnatural watchings of ones movements 
i declare she talked to me once like something mad
or like a fiendno child ever spoke or looked as she
did  i was glad to get her away from the house
what did they do with her at lowood  the fever
389
jane eyre
broke out there and many of the pupils died she
however did not die  but i said she didi wish she
had died  
a strange wish mrs reed  why do you hate
her so 
i had a dislike to her mother always  for she
was my husbands only sister and a great favourite
with him he opposed the familys disowning her
when she made her low marriage  and when news
came of her death he wept like a simpleton he
would send for the baby  though i entreated him
rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance i hated it the first time i set my eyes on
ita sickly whining pining thing  it would wail
in its cradle all night longnot screaming heartily
like any other child but whimpering and moaning
reed pitied it  and he used to nurse it and notice
it as if it had been his own  more indeed than he
ever noticed his own at that age he would try to
make my children friendly to the little beggar  the
darlings could not bear it and he was angry with
them when they showed their dislike in his last
illness he had it brought continually to his bedside 
and but an hour before he died he bound me by
vow to keep the creature i would as soon have
been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse but he was weak naturally weak john
does not at all resemble his father and i am glad of
it john is like me and like my brothers he is
quite a gibson oh i wish he would cease tor390
jane eyre
menting me with letters for money  i have no more
money to give him  we are getting poor i must
send away half the servants and shut up part of the
house or let it off i can never submit to do that
yet how are we to get on  twothirds of my
income goes in paying the interest of mortgages
john gambles dreadfully and always loses poor
boy  he is beset by sharpers  john is sunk and
degradedhis look is frightfuli feel ashamed for
him when i see him
she was getting much excited i think i had
better leave her now said i to bessie who stood on
the other side of the bed
perhaps you had miss  but she often talks in
this way towards night in the morning she is
calmer 
i rose stop   exclaimed mrs reed there
is another thing i wished to say he threatens me
he continually threatens me with his own death
or mine  and i dream sometimes that i see him laid
out with a great wound in his throat or with a
swollen and blackened face i am come to a
strange pass  i have heavy troubles what is to be
done  how is the money to be had  
bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take
a sedative draught  she succeeded with difficulty
soon after mrs reed grew more composed and sank
into a dozing state i then left her
more than ten days elapsed before i had again
any conversation with her she continued either
391
jane eyre
delirious or lethargic  and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her meantime
i got on as well as i could with georgiana and eliza
they were very cold indeed at first eliza would
sit half the day sewing reading or writing and
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister
georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canarybird by the hour and take no notice of me but i
was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation
or amusement  i had brought my drawing materials
with me and they served me for both
provided with a case of pencils and some sheets
of paper i used to take a seat apart from them
near the window and busy myself in sketching fancy
vignettes representing any scene that happened
momentarily to shape itself in the evershifting
kaleidoscope of imagination  a glimpse of sea
between two rocks  the rising moon and a ship
crossing its disc  a group of reeds and waterflags
and a naiads head crowned with lotus flowers
rising out of them  an elf sitting in a hedgesparrows nest under a wreath of hawthornbloom
one morning i fell to sketching a face  what sort
of a face it was to be i did not care or know i
took a soft black pencil gave it a broad point and
worked away soon i had traced on the paper a
broad and prominent forehead and a square lower
outline of visage  that contour gave me pleasure 
my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features
stronglymarked horizontal eyebrows must be traced
392
jane eyre
under that brow  then followed naturally a welldefined nose with a straight ridge and full nostrils 
then a flexible looking mouth by no means narrow 
then a firm chin with a decided cleft down the
middle of it  of course some black whiskers were
wanted and some jetty hair tufted on the temples
and waved above the forehead now for the eyes 
i had left them to the last because they required
the most careful working i drew them large  i
shaped them well  the eyelashes i traced long and
sombre  the irids lustrous and large  good  but
not quite the thing i thought as i surveyed the
effect 66 they want more force and spirit   and i
wrought the shades blacker that the lights might
flash more brilliantlya happy touch or two secured
success there i had a friends face under my
gaze  and what did it signify that those young
ladies turned their backs on me  i looked at it  i
smiled at the speaking likeness  i was absorbed and
content
 is that a portrait of some one you know
asked eliza who had approached me unnoticed i
responded that it was merely a fancy head and
hurried it beneath the other sheets of course i
lied  it was in fact a very faithful representation of
mr rochester but what was that to her or to any
one but myself georgiana also advanced to look
the other drawings pleased her much but she
called that an ugly man  they both seemed
surprised at my skill i offered to sketch their
393
jane eyre
portraits  and each in turn sat for a pencil outline
then georgiana produced her album i promised
to contribute a water colour drawing  this put her
at once into good humour she proposed a walk in
the grounds before we had been out two hours
we were deep in a confidential conversation  she
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant
winter she had spent in london two seasons agoof
the admiration she had there excited the attention
she had received  and i even got hints of the titled
conquest she had made in the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on
various soft conversations were reported and sentimental scenes represented  and in short a volume
of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised
by her for my benefit the communications were
renewed from day to day  they always ran on the
same themeherself her loves and woes
strange she never once adverted either to her
mothers illness or her brothers death or the
present gloomy state of the family prospects her
mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of
past gaiety and aspirations after dissipations to
come she passed about five minutes each day in
her mothers sickroom and no more
it was
eliza still spoke little  she had evidently no time
to talk i never saw a busier person than she
seemed to be  yet it was difficult to say what she
did  or rather to discover any result of her
diligence she had an alarum to call her up early
394
jane eyre
i know not how she occupied herself before breakfast but after that meal she divided her time into
regular portions  and each hour had its allotted
task three times a day she studied a little book
which i found on inspection was a common prayer
book i asked her once what was the great
attraction of that volume and she said the
rubric three hours she gave to stitching with
gold thread the border of a square crimson cloth
almost large enough for a carpet in answer to my
inquiries after the use of this article she informed
me it was a covering for the altar of a new church
lately erected near gateshead two hours she
devoted to her diary  two to working by herself in
the kitchen garden  and one to the regulation of her
accounts she seemed to want no company no
conversation i believe she was happy in her way
this routine sufficed to her  and nothing annoyed
her so much as the occurrence of any incident
which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity
she told me one evening when more disposed to
be communicative than usual that johns conduct
and the threatened ruin of the family had been a
source of profound affliction to her  but she had
now she said settled her mind and formed her
resolution her own fortune she had taken care to
secure  and when her mother diedand it was
wholly improbable she tranquilly remarked that
she should either recover or linger long she would
execute a long cherished project  seek a retirement
395
jane eyre
where punctual habits would be permanently secured
from disturbance and place safe barriers between
herself and a frivolous world i asked if georgiana
would accompany her
of course not georgiana and she had nothing
in common they never had had she would not be
burdened with her society for any consideration
georgiana should take her own course  and she
eliza would take hers
georgiana when not unburdening her heart to
me spent most of her time in lying on the sofa
fretting about the dulness of the house and wishing
over and over again that her aunt gibson would
send her an invitation up to town
it would be so much better she said  if she
could only get out of the way for a month or two
till all was over  i did not ask what she meant by
all being over but i suppose she referred to the
expected decease of her mother and the gloomy
sequel of funeral rites eliza generally took no
more notice of her sisters indolence and complaints
than if no such murmuring lounging object had
been before her one day however as she put
away her accountbook and unfolded her embroidery
she suddenly took her up thus 
georgiana a more vain and absurd animal than
you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth
you had no right to be born  for you make no use
of life instead of living for in and with yourself
as a reasonable being ought you seek only to fasten
396
jane eyre
your feebleness on some other persons strength  if
10 one can be found willing to burden her or
imself with such a fat weak puffy useless thing
you cry out that you are ill treated neglected
niserable then too existence for you must be a
scene of continual change and excitement or else
the world is a dungeon you must be admired you
must be courted you must be flatteredyou must
have music dancing and societyor you languish
you die away have you no sense to devise a system
which will make you independent of all efforts and
all wills but your own  take one day  share it
into sections  to each section apportion its task 
leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour ten
minutes five minutesinclude all do each piece of
business in its turn with method with rigid regularity
the day will close almost before you are aware it
has begun  and you are indebted to no one for
helping you to get rid of one vacant moment  you
have had to seek no ones company conversation
sympathy forbearance  you have lived in short as
an independent being ought to do take this
advice  the first and last i shall offer you  then you
will not want me or any one else happen what may
neglect it go on as heretoforecraving whining
and idling and suffer the results of your idiocy
however bad and insufferable they may be i tell
you this plainly  and listen  for though i shall no
more repeat what i am now about to say i shall
steadily act on it after my mothers death i wash
397
jane eyre
my hands of you  from the day her coffin is carried
to the vault in gateshead church you and i will be
as separate as if we had never known each other
you need not think that because we chanced to be
born of the same parents i shall suffer you to fasten
me down by even the feeblest claim  i can tell you
this if the whole human race ourselves excepted
were swept away and we two stood alone on the
earth i would leave you in the old world and betake
myself to the new 
6
she closed her lips
you might have spared yourself the trouble
of delivering that tirade answered georgiana
everybody knows you are the most selfish heartless creature in existence  and i know your spiteful
hatred towards me  i have had a specimen of it
before in the trick you played me about lord edwin
vere you could not bear me to be raised above
you to have a title to be received into circles
where you dare not show your face and so you
acted the spy and informer and ruined my prospects for ever georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards 
eliza sat cold impassable and assiduously industrious
true generous feeling is made small account of
by some  but here were two natures rendered the
one intolerably acrid the other despicably savourless for the want of it  feeling without judgment
is a washy draught indeed  but judgment untem398
jane eyre
pered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for
human deglutition
it was a wet and windy afternoon  georgiana had
fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel 
eliza was gone to attend a saints day service at the
new churchfor in matters of religion she was a
rigid formalist  no weather ever prevented the
punctual discharge of what she considered her
devotional duties  fair or foul she went to church
thrice every sunday and as often on weekdays as
there were prayers
i bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the
dying woman sped who lay there almost unheeded 
the very servants paid her but a remittent attention 
the hired nurse being little looked after would slip
out of the room whenever she could bessie was
faithful  but she had her own family to mind and
could only come occasionally to the hall i found
the sickroom unwatched as i had expected  no
nurse was there  the patient lay still and seemingly
lethargic  her livid face sunk in the pillows  the
fire was dying in the grate i renewed the fuel
rearranged the bed clothes gazed awhile on her
who could not now gaze on me and then i moved
away to the window
the rain beat strongly against the panes the wind
blew tempestuously   one lies there i thought
who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements
whither will that spiritnow struggling to quit its
material tenementflit when at length released  
399
jane eyre
in pondering the great mystery i thought of
helen burns recalled her dying wordsher faithher doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls i
was still listening in thought to her wellremembered
tonesstill picturing her pale and spiritual aspect
her wasted face and sublime gaze as she lay on her
placid deathbed and whispered her longing to be
restored to her divine fathers bosomwhen a
feeble voice murmured from the couch behind 
who is that 
i knew mrs reed had not spoken for days  was
she reviving  i went up to her
it is i aunt reed
who i was her answer who are you 
looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm but
still not wildly you are quite a stranger to me—
where is bessie  
she is at the lodge aunt 
aunt she repeated who calls me aunt 
you are not one of the gibsons  and yet i know
youthat face and the eyes and forehead are quite
familiar to me you are likewhy you are like jane
eyre  
i said nothing  i was afraid of occasioning some
shock by declaring my identity
66yet said she  i am afraid it is a mistake  my
thoughts deceive me i wished to see jane eyre
and i fancy a likeness where none exists  besides in
eight years she must be so changed  i now gently
assured her that i was the person she supposed and
400
jane eyre
desired me to be  and seeing that i was understood
and that her senses were quite collected i explained
how bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from
thornfield
 i am very ill i know she said ere long  i
was trying to turn myself a few minutes since and
find i cannot move a limb it is as well i should
ease my mind before i die  what we think little of
in health burdens us at such an hour as the present
is to me is the nurse here  or is there no one in
the room but you  
i assured her we were alone
well i have twice done you a wrong which i
regret now one was in breaking the promise which
i gave my husband to bring you up as my own
child  the other she stopped after all it is
of no great importance perhaps  she murmured
to herself  and then i may get better  and to
humble myself so to her is painful 
she made an effort to alter her position but
failed her face changed  she seemed to experience
some inward sensationthe precursor perhaps of
the last pang
well i must get it over eternity is before
me  i had better tell her go to my dressingcase open it and take out a letter you will see
there 
i obeyed her directions read the letter she
said
it was short and thus conceived —

madamwill you have the goodness to send me
the address of my niece jane eyre and to tell me
how she is  it is my intention to write shortly and
desire her to come to me at madeira providence
has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency 
and as i am unmarried and childless i wish to adopt
her during my life and bequeath her at my death
whatever i have to leave i am madam etc etc
 john eyre madeira
it was dated three years back
why did i never hear of this   i asked
because i disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly
ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity i
could not forget your conduct to me janethe fury
with which you once turned on me  the tone in
which you declared you abhorred me the worst of
anybody in the world  the unchildlike look and
voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
of me made you sick and asserted that i had treated
you with miserable cruelty i could not forget my
own sensations when you thus started up and
poured out the venom of your mind  i felt fear as
if an animal that i had struck or pushed had looked
up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a
mans voice bring me some water  oh make
haste  
dear mrs reed said i as i offered her the
draught she required  think no more of all this let
it pass away from your mind forgive me for my
402
jane eyre
passionate language  i was a child then  eight nine
years have passed since that day
she heeded nothing of what i said  but when she
had tasted the water and drawn breath she went on
thus
 i tell you i could not forget it  and i took my
revenge for you to be adopted by your uncle and
placed in a state of ease and comfort was what i
could not endure i wrote to him  i said i was
sorry for his disappointment but jane eyre was
dead  she had died of typhus fever at lowood
now act as you please  write and contradict my
assertion—expose my falsehood as soon as you like
you were born i think to be my torment  my last
hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which
but for you i should never have been tempted to
commit 
if you could but be persuaded to think no more
of it aunt and to regard me with kindness and
forgiveness
you have a very bad disposition said she  and
one to this day i feel it impossible to understand 
howfor nine years you could be patient and quiescent
under any treatment and in the tenth break out
all fire and violence i can never comprehend 
my disposition is not so bad as you think  i am
passionate but not vindictive many a time as a
little child i should have been glad to love you if
you would have let me  and i long earnestly to be
reconciled to you now  kiss me aunt 
403
jane eyre
i approached my cheek to her lips  she would
not touch it she said i oppressed her by leaning
over the bed  and again demanded water as i
laid her downfor i raised and supported her on
my arm while she dranki covered her icecold and
clammy hand with mine  the feeble fingers shrank
from my touchthe glazing eyes shunned my gaze
 love me then or hate me as you will i said at
last  you have my full and free forgiveness  ask
now for gods  and be at peace 
poor suffering woman  it was too late for her to
make now the effort to change her habitual frame of
mind  living she had ever hated medying she
must hate me still
the nurse now entered and bessie followed i
yet lingered half an hour longer hoping to see some
sign of amity  but she gave none she was fast
relapsing into stupor  nor did her mind again rally 
at twelve oclock that night she died i was not
present to close her eyes  nor were either of her
daughters they came to tell us the next morning
that all was over she was by that time laid out
eliza and i went to look at her  georgiana who
had burst out into loud weeping said she dared not
go there was stretched sarah reeds once robust
and active frame rigid and still her eye of flint was
covered with its cold lid  her brow and strong traits
wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul a
strange and solemn object was that corpse to me i
gazed on it with gloom and pain  nothing soft
404
jane eyre
nothing sweet nothing pitying or hopeful or
subduing did it inspire  only a grating anguish for
her woesnot my lossand a sombre tearless
dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form
eliza surveyed her parent calmly after a silence
ofsome minutes she observed —
with her constitution she should have lived to a
good old age  her life was shortened by trouble 
and then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
instant as it passed away she turned and left the
room and so did i neither of us had dropped a
tear
